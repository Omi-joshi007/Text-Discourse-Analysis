willia roman justin in partial fulfillment required in our subject business research introduction online food delivery service is a process of ordering food online through websites and applications while impact defined as having a strong effect to someone or something a pandemic is defined as an epidemic that crosses international boundaries affecting people in a worldwide scale let us have a brief history about the virus called coronavirus or mainly covet 19. it was in december of 2019 when they discover a virus in mainland china the virus originated in a wet market in wuwan china a wet market refers to a marketplace where they sell live animals like fish cats dogs bats rabbits and many more where the market floor is constantly being washed because of slaughtering there are three main roles in a successful process of online food delivery service the consumer who order the food the transporter or the rider who brings the food and the seller who sends the food [Music] in this study we mainly focus on the transporter or the riders who is more vulnerable to get infected by calvin 19. this is also to give recognition to them who also serve as front liners statement of the problem first we get the social demographic profile of the online food delivery riders their location age gender and their salary profit second is the safety protocols of the riders during the pandemic under this the medical supplies the senate decision and simple guidelines they follow [Music] number three factors that affects the income of the riders under this the income under income lockdown effect and increase of income second is the factors under factors curfew and city lockdowns and lastly rider's interruption to consumers under this customer sensitivity for food and service and next is customer satisfaction the conceptual framework first we input from the web research related literatures related studies and data then we process and find the target respondents make the questionnaires validate the questionnaires gather the data through the research instrument then analyze the data then it comes the output after the output last is the interpretation of the study and feedback the theoretical framework the study applied ung theory and found eight keys gratification behind the use of fda namely convenience societal strain customer experience delivery experience quest of restaurants quality control listing and ease of use the finding shows that customer experience search of restaurants is of use and listing were the major antecedents of intention to use fda fda is simply food delivery apps the research includes various implications about how the online food delivery service still handles the new process of services offered people use delivery apps or websites for their comfort and ease but when the pandemic came people changed their perspective not only for having ease and comfort but also for their safety that they don't need to go out and expose themselves from the virus that is why the riders are considered as front liners as they're also public facing entity the hypothesis the pandemic causes big change and impact on the input delivery service which regards their income nature of work in the new normal and how they deliver proper and clean and good service to people as they are the one who are early permitted to go out and put service to the people the significance of the study this study signifies the role of this industry during these times of the pandemic how important this industry works for us especially in this time that the government implies the safety protocol to lessen the spread of the virus people often prepare to order online which is good that we don't need to go out and risk ourselves exposing our body outside as we all know that there are deadly viables roaming in our place it lessens the risk of getting infected by this virus because we don't have to socialize with other people and expose ourselves the only concerns is the recognition how hard for these guys referring to the riders who gave us the services that we needed in order for them to earn income they are the one who raised and exposed themselves to the virus it is an eye-opener topic for us to who stay at home and keep ourselves safe during this pandemic while there are these frontliners who risk their lives to give us the services we need and now we are heading to the chapter 2 the review of related literatures and studies foreign literatures according to industry sources tapawid 19 pandemic has introduced a new challenge to the food distribution industry which could have an effect on online food delivery services or ofds by hillary 2020 restaurants and related providers especially fast foods restaurants are able to provide food customers on the other hand are worthy of placing orders during the pandemic despite the fact of ofts have required their delivery partners to wear personal protective equipment and encourage customers to pay digitally to ensure contactless delivery as you can see this picture shows a contactless delivery where you need to distance yourself while receiving or sending a food delivery local literature copy 19 pandemic has shifted the retail landscape from brick and mortar to online processing of orders and connecting to last mile logistic providers to address the growing demands of people that are confined in their homes by leica 2020 and maquila 2020 buying and selling of goods services by a buyer use modalities online is called e-commerce or easy in short by castro 2019 and maquila 2020 claimed that by 2022 easy activities are projected to account for half of the country's economy here is a picture of online food delivery a perfect example of an e-commerce foreign studies study shows that whenever people see it somewhere they develop self-protective behavior in normal conditions self-protective behavior is not observed by customers while they make a purchase decision during disease outbreaks such as sars avian influenza h1n1 influenza proving spongy form [Music] encephalopathy and the corbit 19. the self-protective behavior becomes significantly pronounced the fear of getting infections spread faster than the disease itself by addo 2020 del isle 2004 market and sean 2004 when 2020. as you can see in this picture it portrays of the fear of getting infected by the virus local studies the study for safety measures include contactless delivery for grab food introduced this week to minimize contact between consumers and delivery partners consumers can option out for contactless delivery by following three simple steps first inform delivery partners to drop off the order outside the door or at a specific location such as the building reception if allowed by the building management second delivery partners will place the order at the specified location notify consumers of their arrival and wait for them to pick up the order standing at least six feet or two meters away from the order and third we strongly encourage consumers the option for cashless payment if it is unavailable to use cash they can place the amount in an envelope and leave it where the food order is by fieldstar 2020 as we see in the picture there is a specific location where the food needed to be trapped off in chapter 3 we need to tackle the research design and the methodology the researchers use the quantitative method to be conducted through online survey questionnaire sent to the target respondents which is the writers of online food delivery service the data gathered will be statistically and mathematically analyzed through this method we also use descriptive method as we interpret accurately the collected data from the respondents this is the average or statistical interpretation of data gathered to be described in which category it will fall true quantitative information we aim to get 50 respondents but only few responded to our survey questionnaire that's why we need to downsize it to 30 riders and we do receive response from out of 30 plus rider the research instrument our research instrument or the tool we use is google survey forms it is a form of gathering data where you will answer the form online we made the social demographic form for the legitimate information of the respondents then the second part is the questionnaires to be answered according to the scale of interpreted options we use likert scale format it is designed to determine which category is average answer will fall the numbers depends on the intensity of the answer it is a five point likert scale format we also use weight and mean it is the measure of general response from the questionnaires and survey when the survey findings have been evaluated there is also a methodological approach to follow here's the formula how to get the weighted mean weighted mean is equal to sum of scale multiplied by weighted factor divided by sum of all weights and now let's proceed to chapter 4 presentation and data interpretation and analysis question number one how important for you riders to use and what medical supplies

who gave us comfort and safety by risking their lives quickly following the guidelines and safety protocols facing everyday danger to serve us and bring home money for their family probably 19 impacts their income but yet they are still there serving us how lockdown affect their income how curfew limits their working hours and how city laptops limit their territories we all know it is so hard and how bad it is to be exposed in the public it is very risky and not advisable though their income increases it is because it is said that there is this that we call self-protective behavior which is very evidently shown nowadays protecting ourselves in the most effective and possible way that we can do but let's just think about these heroes we pray for them that even if it's so hard for them to face every day like we do like everyone else does let's just hope that this pandemic will come to an end soon findings of the study based on the data we gathered the finding of the study is somewhat good and bad good in terms of the income increase because of the demand and online food delivery service good as they value strict sanitization and guidelines of the government practicing the best service they can provide but it is somehow bad because of the restrictions and limited working hours and the most risky is to be exposed to the public providing service because it is their way of living we cannot blame them it is a highly in demand job right now people lessen their time to go out and be exposed to public 19. we strongly believe that the sector is highly affected there is still good in it that we are more justified appreciating every well-being of everyone especially the frontliners how important sanitization is we learn about the consumer behavior and how e-commerce took place to keep us all safe with cashless payments and contactless delivery for the conclusion number one we therefore conclude based on the data gathered it is highly important for the transporters to sanitize not only food but also their selves and strictly follow the safety protocols and guidelines of the government [Music] next is and we also conclude that there are increase of income for majority of the riders who worked under online food delivery service the third is we also conclude that restriction from this pandemic affects the working hours and rich territories of riders as they face everyday challenges with lockdowns and curfews and last we also conclude that this online food delivery service serves a big role in this pandemic as we foresee that people took it as one of the main options for buying food instead of going out our recommendations that we learned from this study [Music] is to online food delivery service is one of the fastest growing sectors better to invest and learn online selling second practice cashless payments third practice contactless delivery fourth we as consumers should practice also the proper sanitization fifth respect every foot delivery riders and hear them out with their concerns the next one is practice ordering online to lessen the risk of getting infected outside our home next teach the elders how e-commerce works and last pray for every day that we are saved and pray for the others to be safe also order only the essentials for us to live and lastly pray for this pandemic to end that's all for our research thank you
