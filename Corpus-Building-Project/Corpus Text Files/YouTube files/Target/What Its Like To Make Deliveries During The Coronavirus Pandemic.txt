as the coronavirus has upended all of our lives and routines we've become reliant upon certain essential workers to help us stay as safe and healthy as possible of course this includes medical professionals who can treat those who do fall ill but it also includes a class of workers many of us have previously taken for granted delivery people make it possible for the rest of us to stay healthy by staying home since the crisis Americans are turning to delivery services more than ever before and gig workers for Amazon flex coober eats instacart post mates GrubHub shift and or - are helping people fill their basic needs these delivery people especially those shopping for and delivering food risk exposure every day as they burn groceries precooked meals and packages straight to our front doors we never have thought of people doing these kinds of jobs as frontline workers in many ways facing risks that have parallels to health care providers and first responders Amazon is struggling to keep up with demand for grocery deliveries and is hiring a hundred and seventy-five thousand full and part-time employees across its warehouse and delivery network as the recent search and online orders has caused uncharacteristically long delays and instacart is bringing on three hundred thousand new gig workers which the company refers to as shoppers I was going to the groceries for anywhere from 8 to 15 times a day sometimes I'll be in a store and there are more insta car shoppers an actual shoppers I don't mind the work but at the same time since these companies don't provide any sort of health insurance or any healthcare benefits you really got to watch out for yourself the current moment has brought long-standing concerns about protections for gig workers to the floor and now discussion is swirling about what these companies ought to provide in a time of crisis many workers are pushing for hazard pay higher wages that acknowledge the increased risks they now face but most companies aren't offering it while many companies are now beginning to offer personal protective equipment for workers for the past month many delivery people have spent their own money on supplies they expect me to spend money keeping a constant supply of wipes Lysol but with over 16 million Americans filing unemployment claims over the past three weeks gig economy jobs are in higher demand than ever this work can entail delivering packages for a company like Amazon delivering preordered food with the likes of ubereats doordash grub hub or post mates or shopping for and delivering groceries with apps like instant workers can set their own schedules accepting orders or signing up for shifts through the app itself it's flexible work and it's easy to start some markets have been known to have long wait lists of potential workers ready to start delivering at any moment however this does make it hard for those who are frustrated with a job to educate for change whenever somebody decides you know I'm not going to do this anymore I feel like when I treat it barely I'm going to quit the app there's 10 people in line right behind you just start working to basically cover you these gig workers aren't technically employees so they can't unionize this means it may take legislation at the state or federal level to see meaningful change but in the meantime their services are what allowed the rest of us to stay home as much as possible there's a lot of very first time and especially for people who are vulnerable and susceptible it's a really important thing for them to be able to have this demand for many delivery services especially groceries has spiked in recent weeks meaning workers must make a tough choice between increased earning potential and their own safety on a single day in mid-march downloads of instacart were up 218 percent and downloads of ships were up 120 4% we're putting more hours in than we've ever done before usually I work about 30 to 40 hours a week doing these gigs and the last two weeks I've been pulling at least 55 to 60 hours Instagram reported on March 30th that shopper earnings had increased by more than 40 percent month-over-month and shoppers on average we're seeing a 30 percent increase in customer tips average earnings for these apps as reported on glass doors hover between 10 to 14 dollars per hour except for Amazon flex which promises a base pay of at least $15 per hour for many of these gigs the pay structure is ever-changing an opaque formula that takes into account factors such as items ordered distance driven how long the order took to complete plus tips small tweaks can instantly change the income of hundreds of thousands of gig workers but what these algorithms don't take into account is the risk workers face delivering during a pandemic as they ferry packages groceries and meals to people's doors we walk up to the counter we're touching you know door handles and cash register machines like the credit card scanners all of them the longer we all are working from our homes the more we're going to need people to provide us food and packages and all these kinds of things so in the short term I think we have the formula for increasing risk on more people in the intensification of some of the problems we did discussing instacart shoppers also noted that in the first couple weeks of lockdown grocery stores were especially crowded which made it difficult to shop efficiently while also socially distancing costco has been one of the biggest poems for us and it's also one of the most demanded stores on the app right now these frustrations and concerns have driven some away while Perales used to work for instacart he says he has no interest in doing so during the crisis you're talking about hundreds of people in the grocery store at a time 30 minute long lines it's just not worth putting my health on the line tensions among instacart workers culminated in a strike on March 30th they demanded that instacart provide shoppers with free personal protective equipment hazard pay and an expansion of paid leave for those impacted by coronavirus the strike wasn't nice like wanting to start a fight we're letting out a cry for help and all of sabang during these times of crisis strike organizers said thousands of workers participated meaning these regular shoppers didn't log into the app or make deliveries but instacart said it had no effect on business and claimed there were actually 40% more workers than usual on the platform on the day of the strike and that the company had set a record for groceries souls in a 72-hour period instead of a strike it was more like a boycott and those don't work there's always gonna be people to take those shifts and there's always gonna be people to take every order but even satisfied workers say these companies could and should be doing more I feel as though we used to card as well as doing and it is a good company I think they have the resources to send us supplies to be able to keep people safe especially gloves there should be some requirements and even a training video with a quiz following which is what we have to do when getting approved to deliver alcohol and pharmaceuticals three days after the strike instacart said it would provide face masks hand sanitizer and thermometers to its shoppers I'm not worried about myself getting it I'm nervous that I may get it and I'll never know but then inadvertently you spread it almost in an entire county of my state that's what worries me most a study led by the National Institute of Health found the virus is stable for up to 24 hours on cardboard two to three days on plastic and stainless steel and three hours in the air suggesting people may become infected after touching contaminated objects these companies have already changed some of their policies to help keep customers safe for example instacart doordash GrubHub post maids ships and ubereats have all put tools in place so the customer and delivery person do not need to interact now we can do contact tools delivery that is one thing that Scott has done a really good job on and then we leave though at the door we take a photo in the net a sense of the customer and they know they can come outside and get their groceries and after we've left furthermore instigates announcement that they'll provide protective equipment for workers comes on the heels of similar promises from other companies Jordache allows workers to order hand sanitizer and gloves free from its website not including a small shipping fee GrubHub says it will start shipping protective equipment to workers in mid-april and ubereats and amazon flex say they're now distributing masks to drivers but when it comes to dealing with delivery people who have already fallen ill some report frustrating experiences most of these companies have promised to pay workers impacted by the pandemic Amazon launched a 25 million dollar relief fund to provide quarantine seasonal workers and delivery drivers with two weeks of paid leave uber post made store - ships and instacart have made similar commitments but for many applying for this pay has been difficult initially many companies required proof that a worker had contracted coronavirus but testing was severely limited when parolees feared he'd come down with the disease in mid-march he ran into a number of bureaucratic hurdles before he saw any money I went to the hospital just to be safe because that's what whoever told me to do they told me that it sounded like I might have covered 19 and that I should self quarantine they weren't doing tests at the time because they were rationing the tests there was a nationwide shortage from there you know I was fighting back and forth with uber trying to get some sort of compensation because by that point they had actually suspended me but they hadn't paid me eventually promises uber paid him 317 dollars after BuzzFeed news contacted the company about his case this amount was meant to cover his two weeks of sub quarantine which he says is far below what he would have normally earned and it's Mintz at CNBC uber affirmed its commitment to its drivers and delivery people and said it has a team working around the clock to support them but it's a little consolation to parole it they're paying us lip service but they're not actually taking any actions to keep the public safe to keep their drivers safe others say that expecting much more out of these companies is unrealistic in most states they aren't required to provide additional protections or paid sick leave and that's just how the contractor contract fee relationship goes generally the cost of doing business is on the contractor but then we write off our expenses on our taxes so I would never expect them to just give me stuff if they did that would be great but legally they don't have to and they're generally not going to it may ultimately take new legislation that changes the dynamic between gigg workers and their employers for these companies to actually provide delivery people with the protections they're asking for we really need to redo our employment laws not only for the protection of workers but for the protection of society I think the pandemic has demonstrated in such a clear way the interrelated nature of all of us and what sometimes binds us to one another our workers who are doing this kind of work and when they're not adequately protected we all lose protections as a result of that the two trillion dollar coronavirus stimulus bill offers a ray of hope as it extends unemployment benefits to gig workers we have an opportunity to rebuild an economy that's stronger and that plug some of these gaping holes that have been revealed in the short-term though many delivery people and gig workers in general will probably be left in the lurch states are scrambling to process the record number of jobless claims they've received an initial reports reveal that many gig workers are encountering the same difficulties as Perales hitting a bureaucratic wall when they try to collect payment but even as they struggle to make a living in this new reality many hope the crisis will be a turning point I'm glad people are waking up to the reality that the way things are now the sort of protections that we have or don't have they're not adequate whether a crisis there's a cultural shift that's about to happen these these workers that are considered essential they're I feel like they're going to be treated with more respect after this and I think it's up to us everybody to make sure that that positive cultural change is permanent
