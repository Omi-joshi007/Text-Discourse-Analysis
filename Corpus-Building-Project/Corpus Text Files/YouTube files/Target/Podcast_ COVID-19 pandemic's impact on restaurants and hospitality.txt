local stories local people we're taking you inside western mass news it's an even better western mass podcast with Dave Matson good to have you with us for this week's edition of even better Western Mass here we are now halfway through the month of May some states are easing their stay at home restrictions golf courses with the restrictions are open across Massachusetts now I've played a few times just great to get back out there and see friends that I haven't seen for a few weeks we've talked a lot but we haven't really seen each other golf courses are in great shape of course I play on hasn't really been crowded as I think people are kind of easing back into things wherever you are I hope you're doing well and staying healthy well in this week's edition of even better you're going to hear from Anthony fresco who's the general manager of quality beverages chickabee distribution center Anthony and I talked about the impact of the Cova 19 shutdown on bars restaurants and package stores in Hampden Hampshire and Franklin counties and his company's business my first guests though is Peter Rostov and a good friend Peter has been a mainstay in the Western mass food and hospitality industry for more than 40 years now first with Boston chicken later Boston Market in the mid-90s he renovated and reinvented the landmark log cabin restaurant in Holyoke purchased the Delaney house in Holyoke and later the adjacent D Hotel and Suites he created a catering operation known as log rolling an open coffee and sandwich shops called Mountain Joe to go his latest venture opening up a number of Delaney's markets which Peter describes as well a retail store for foods featured at his restaurants Peter and I talked about reopening his restaurants in the kovat nineteen world and the challenges it's created we're now two months into this Cove in nineteen crisis let's talk about the impact that it has had on your business and I know it's been a big one yeah all of us in business have been impacted by this so this is not just us I think everybody's hurting in one way or another for us it's it's not being able to do events for us it's not being able to do a restaurant we chose not to do takeout I don't know if you're aware of that mainly because we were worried to take our loan profitable enough and so so we are focusing our energies from delivering meals which we've done a lot of our galini's market which are doing well thanks having and then just being smart about what we do and in conserving every penny so we're ready for when we can get going again now did you have a plan in place would all of this happen when the shutdown began or is this something you you you put together over a couple of days oh yeah there's no I I gotta be honest I wish I had a plan because no maybe not I would have been very depressed putting this plan together no no no no such a plan you know us Mick and I specifically but my wife we're really fighters so the second we got shut down we just started thinking how can we be a little different how can we do something that helps us get through this and once one side is to minimize your expenses and then the other side is okay what can I do that gives me an edge that gives me in business and we created this $5.00 meal I don't know if you've seen that a little mint and we've had a lot of success with that we're not making money with five dollar meal babe but but it's it's working it's it's we can Home Depot's bind and we got the we got his woman in Hadley she is an amazing woman she decided that she wanted to buy these meals for our neighborhood one one week and we're pretty much delivering four or 500 meals to house once a week and then her neighborhood comes and picks him up very cute little story so so the stuff that's come out of this five dollar meal and I can spend a half an hour just telling you about it not a moneymaker but it feels good to pick a few people work I've been the delivery driver I went from running the company to delivery but I love delivering you see people you walk into the hospital wherever you walk into and you could greeted very warmly people really liked it so it's been the silver lining in this thing you know you're always I I've always been we've talked about this before always kind of one step ahead of the game as far as marketing and doing different things so I guess part of this too is while you're not making a lot of money on it you are keeping some people employed and you keep name out there yeah back to your question about plan this was not at all the idea we created the ritual thought behind the $5 meal was let's create something that we can sell to a home depot who is still our customer in so they can feed their employees in a cost-effective way because they're essential workers and it's evolved and and you complain when those things we're just lucky that we thought of a product that is making some sense and and and it's given us an opportunity to work a little bit so between bad and Gladys market that's been our focus over the last eight weeks and I got a feeling it's gonna be a focus for a few more weeks I think yeah absolutely I think you're right then let's also talk to that this comes at a very busy time of year for you with graduations in the start of the wedding season and all sorts of different events ya know May is when you first talked about this in March and we saw it coming in March like like like at the beginning of March all of a sudden the parade committees canceling an event or one thing is happening something is happening you kind of saw it coming and then abruptly on March 16th it's be done and and so you look at March and say okay I can survive March and then you look at April and I can survive April those are still not the greatest month but once you get to May it really hurts and in our business we make a livelihood really in May in June and then we make a livelihood again in September to October it's like everybody that wants to plan events focuses on those four months in a year not everybody but the majority goes right there so so we're dealing with that but like I said to you I can whine and and pout but I think we're all in this we've got to figure a way out of this one you're dealing with these families too you know whether it's a an anniversary party or a graduation party or a wedding who I'm sure their while they may be postponing it they'll be back to do this because you know these are things that you still have to do they might actually find it amazing so people ask me all the time I just had a conversation a few minutes ago with somebody what are you doing with all these cancellations and you know the amount of cancellations is almost non-existent most people like 99 percent of them have moved their events like I have had couples that have moved their wedding now twice so they had a wedding in April May they moved into the midsummer now they're worried about the midsummer and other finding a day later in a year even early next year I find it amazing how people are adapting to it and not just canceling I was talking to two business Western a little while ago they are fully committed as a corporate event planner to have their big events and they want to do them safely they want to do them in a smart way at the right time I think that's what our spirit and Western Mass is all about and I'm just proud to be part of it I know it's hard work to deal with it but people are trying really hard not to pee and so things I was talking to Mary Kay wide were she's a guest on this last week and I know you're involved with the Convention and Visitors Bureau the hit the valley has taken I think up to last week she said there were like a hundred eighteen events that were canceled here so this is this is having a major impact as far as a I don't think folks realize the importance of tourism and is here in western mass well I'm passionate about the Convention and Visitor's Bureau it's actually one of the organizations that put a lot of effort into and she's right she's at a different different boat that we are as a restaurant or as a venue because the events that get booked at the massmutual center or who plan dia that's being booked at the Basketball Hall of Fame or anything like that those cannot be easily rescheduled those things get postponed the whole year so you miss 2020 that expense is incredible and I don't even know the multiplier of it but that's a huge expense to our business it's not just restaurants but retail stores the hotels of course I'm worried about the hotels I the hotels just like the event venues will have a very slow wrap-up of the discus who's gonna quickly travel that's it and it's the other part of this too is as we were talking about it is you don't realize the tax implications of this as far as retail with the sales tax as far as hotels and restaurants with those taxes to that impact I'm excited about one thing on this and I'm gonna be facetious for a second but I always feel we don't get the credit with the serve in the hospitality business but I think I'll stay there our governor they're really gonna realize how important we are to the budget because the amount of money that comes through us that goes into the cities and into the state is enormous I believe in western mass with the second largest industry I know in the state with a third largest if you look at the entire state I know that will be felt unfortunately but I know where we thought the uncertainty of this because yes the governor has a four point plan as far as opening things back up but everything he does has an impact on what you do as far as what you can and can't do yeah we're ready so this is the big conversation right now because we're all waiting for what's gonna go on this four stages who exactly can operate on stage one stage two or phase one phase two and we need that answer by the way we're really desperately doing this is not a criticism I just I just really feel that it's business owners we need a plan we need to be able to say okay my business fits interface two or my business fits into phase three I don't think we're fitting to face one that's why I don't even mentioning it and then we know what we need to do and we know that phase one starts next Monday so we have the likelihood that two weeks later three weeks later space too so it gives us a parameter to work which is something I'm craving right now I'm itching to to figure out a way to work and finalize our plans we're ready to open next week by the way we we have internally godno cells ready to to if the governor says so to be able to open next Friday we are making a whole bunch of assumptions but I wanted to we wanted to to have a plan in place so we could adjust a little bit but actually be able to execute so if he says go on Monday it takes us a few days to do a few things and we can actually open them Friday even though I don't believe that's gonna happen I think we're a few weeks away and what will that look like when you do reopen so here are the thoughts philosophy we've got some marketing thoughts and we've got some operational thoughts but let's we're honestly thinking events is sometime in the summer and we need guidelines on events so so the event side of the business I think it's still not in the media future for us the restaurant I feel outdoor dining is gonna be a key part to to the restaurant and and you know a restaurant well we have this beautiful tent in the back we're working really hard on making them look really good and getting it ready with with all kinds of frills making sure the tables of six feet apart making sure that the service can talk to you six feet away I'm planning or we're planning a live entertainment we're going to make sure there's a spot for that and how do we take reservations how do we minimize all these concerns that we have a sanitation or or cross-contamination and and that's how it's gonna look like I think I think we're gonna start with outdoor dining in the restaurant I think we will start with curbside pickup and then the other piece that we're excited about is we have a hotel we want you and everybody else to come and have a night that the hotel order room service and get away from kids or grandkids and have a little bit of fun so so those are the key things we see coming I'm guessing part of your marketing plan too is to make sure your customers are comfortable with the fact that they can come back and they're gonna be safe yeah I do feel and I wanna say this to anybody listening the restaurant business in the hospitality business has always been set up we already have it ingrained in our body that we have to do certain things very safely so we always sanitize tables and we always washed hands and and we've always worn gloves and we've done a lot of those things over the years as part of the normal day-to-day business we just have to elevate that to a new level now and we need to make sure that our guests know what we're doing so I believe masks are gonna be a must and we're ready for that if we get to open next week we have a person that is all this person is doing is wiping down surfaces that people touch from the toilet handle to the door to whatever they might touch we're just gonna keep on walking this person around in a specific sequence to make sure everything gets wiped down obviously paper menus is coming down you're not gonna be looking at plastic menus we're working on getting our menu on on a QR code so you can read it on your own cell phone so you don't have to touch a menu and on and on there's so many things that we're thinking and we're working on implementing so we can be open in a safe way Fergus I think a lot of this too will become a business plan from here on out I do I my worry and I had a really great interaction with with our congressman Richard Neal and we talked openly about this and my worry is is one that I haven't put my hands on my finger on all these things cost extra money so we're dealing with shortages of beef and shortages of chicken and prices that are going up so there's a problem then now we have masks and extra staff to do additional sanitation and then we have lower table capacity so we have lower economies of scale and on and on there's so many little hidden costs here that the cost of operation per person or per guest is going to go up quite radically and and how do you price it in a way that a guest will come to you and feel it's a good deal and I suppose do we look at this to think of the time where we are going to get back to where we were before all of this hit in in March then if if that's ever a reality for us anymore I heard somebody mentioned the other day that this whole thing is nature's way of saying you thought you were in control but you're not we've never been in control I agree with you I think I think there will be a new normal or new reality and I'm certainly hoping that I can give everybody alike a hug again and I'm certainly hoping I can shake hands again but I I think we're gonna think twice about a lot of things I stopped at one of my clients today market fort they're the great client of ours and I stopped by there today and I'm literally 20 feet away from from one of the managers and as I approached his door he instinctively just puts his mask up it's like like we're ready set up in a way that that is different like so radical so it's hard to comprehend what we're dealing with it really is well prior to this - we always thought when you saw somebody walk in with a mess there was nothing but trouble ahead [Laughter] exactly Peter is I think it's funny that you saying that because we Delaney's market we we started the mandatory masks probably five weeks ago and and and I remember talking about it and and and our staff and managers looking at me like we had three heads on because they were worried that we would look like Aang stirs and and now it's like okay if you don't come in with a mask we got an issue I know we would we went to the one in Westfield and at the counter when we were checking out the the clerk said something to us about that night you look just fine I said you have very kind eyes nice the good news is nobody knows who you are anymore right that couple with the fact I haven't been on the air much for a year that adds up to it so you're probably the most recognizable person in western mass but with with a mask I don't know you might look a little different that said it just you know it is the way it is and Peter the overall impact I mean you know when we started the year this was the last thing I think anybody would think was going to happen do you think we're not going to get back to that normal until there's a vaccine I think is probably the best way to look at it I think the vaccine is gonna be the comfort I struggling with with how people are gonna feel okay without eliminating the worry that they're gonna get it are they gonna get six so either either they they're proven to be able to not feel the symptoms so they don't care or there's a vaccine that cures this and I don't see the normal or the new normal starting until this happens this thing is scary you see a lot of people die it's I don't know any other way to put it it scary you know it's not gonna come out of our head for a while sure you've been in business for a long time and you've seen a lot and this was I think the last thing we expected to see but what I've always enjoyed about you Peter is your optimism and and your optimism about going forward well I think that it's up to us and it's up to you as well because you're on the air a lot I think as leaders we we need to figure out what is the good out of this and and what can we do to make something better shame on us if we go through these six months or a year of this kind of trouble and we don't find a way to do something smart or better out of this is it is it a smarter social world is it a smarter business what is it that we can do to be stronger and better than we we're at the beginning of 2020 and and I think in my little world I think that's my approach to thinks and I don't like to focus too much on a negative I want to figure out a way to make this into a positive I think you and I think the same thing everything happens for a reason and in somewhere down the line we will understand what the reason was for this and and as you said it would be it would be sinful if something good doesn't come out of this I agree with you and and the other piece too is you aware that I lost my mom last year and I've been thinking about my mom a lot for my my parents as a whole because my mom grew up during World War two and she lived in a perfect world like before this thing really hit I mean wealthy well taken care of everything was perfect and then comes this war that destroys this country Germany the way it did and she lost everything and it was ten fifteen years of her life completely torn apart we're looking at six months or a year and we'll come out of this we'll figure it out and we'll do something I don't see this being 15 years of trouble at least I sincerely hope it's not gonna be this is to me something that sometime next year the fear of this will be gone and then we just have to deal with but I said earlier I'm hoping that we do something good out of it so and I like that I think you're right they kind of put things into perspective I often think what what my mom and dad would think about this and I'm sure you think the same thing about your mom too and on the whole scope of things what they went through this isn't a lot now I that's that's been my motivation on this because I don't think we can comprehend what our parents or in my case my parents were sure went through back then in the kind of stuff that they have to put up with and yeah we're stuck at home but we don't have it all I mean we're eating we're living we're not fighting for a potato or two potatoes playing games we don't soom it could be a lot worse it really could be a lot worse and that's why I think if you're putting in very good works that there's a perspective here that we need to keep in mind that move forward my thanks to Peter Roskam for taking time to be with me on this week's edition of even better Western Mass my next guest is a longtime friend we met many many years ago on the Jimmy Fund Council of Western Mass he's Anthony Frasca who's the general manager of equality beverages Chicopee Distribution Center quality which is based in Taunton took ownership of Williams distributing in Chicopee last fall Williams was owned by the Sadowski family for some 69 years Anthony and I talked about the impact the kovat 19 shutdown has on his business and on bars restaurants and package stores in the Pioneer Valley let's talk about the impact of Kovach 19 coronavirus on on your business this is a big time of year for you i no question Dave you know certainly started back in early March when the entire on premise segment of our business was forced to close basically overnight right around the st. Patrick's Day and coming into a busy time of the year and we call on 940 customers here in Hamden in Hampshire County and literally overnight we lost about 700 of those customers because of the shutdowns which you know we certainly all understand you know looking back in time of what needed to be done but it's been a big impact on our business we were just getting our feet wet really becoming a new company back in October and you know things were going very well one of the most smooth transitions you could ever ask for going from Williams distributing the quality beverage and COBIT struck and and you know we're dealing with that on an everyday basis paying attention to everything that's happening from guidelines coming out and and where we should be focusing our efforts on safe employees safety is number one right so that's we have a lot of safety protocols within our facility from temperature checking to keep them Outsiders out of our building to limiting the amount of people in their chickabee added another element which was mask wearing within all essential businesses probably a good thing we were pretty much there anyways and so so having employees wear masks in the facility other another added step and really we we struggled in the beginning securing masks and sanitizer and cleaning supplies to get to wear and gloves to where we are today but right now we're in pretty good shape how many employees affected by this whole thing anthony at your place so quality beverage is over 300 employees in total with our three locations taught and Auburn and Chicopee and Chicopee about 82 employs roughly not counting any seasonal part-timers we did have to lay some folks off as we lost those 700 customers in March we worked as long as we could and but I exciting news that we're bringing them all back this Monday the 18th and as we start to learn more about the governor's four phase plan we're getting ready to get back to business and that segment of business that we we lost fortunately we have had the off-premise part of our business roughly about 240 accounts still still active and and that has really kept us busy for sure over the over the last several weeks now those 700 businesses do you talk about you talk mostly restaurants restaurants bars clubs and then special events which you know that coming into our special event season really started with Saint Patrick's roadways which was you know canceled the you know five days in advance of the you know the shutdowns we're right around the corner from that you know retailers were getting ready and in the Holyoke area and you know special events are a large large part of our businesses you know things are happening in the tourism industry like the concert series outside of MGM during the summer all things that we we really missed obviously sure now where do you fall within the governor's plan his four-point plan yeah we don't know exactly right we we know again the off-premise was able to keep selling product as an essential part of the business which means we were essential in that regard and then a few weeks back the on premise was allowed to sell beer if it accompanied food to go so so we've had a few on-premise retailers that have been selling beer to go along with food to go and you know what we'll learn as late as Monday maybe we'll learn something before them but I think Monday we'll learn exactly how our restaurants our bars fit into the plan you know do they have limited capacity we will there be outside dining only we we don't know we're just like everybody else we're paying attention as a association of other math bureaus we pay attention to what's happening but I think the governor's kept this one pretty close to the vest and we're expecting to hear a lot of information about timing as early as this Monday Peter Rostov and of course you know Peter well from the Delaney house and and the log cabin was saying the biggest thing with this is the uncertainty really not knowing you could open but how people are going to react as we go ahead yeah I think I think that's gonna be the hardest part for businesses to remain stable and you know determine how many employees they're able to bring back and how many employees are able to retain certainly consumers and you and I are two of them you know we're all looking at our own personal views on you know what's what's what's okay what's not okay and what are we comfortable with them what are we not comfortable with I think we'll hear from the mask guidelines about restrictions it's no surprise to anybody six foot table separation limited capacity to start but what we don't know as you mentioned Peter said is how long right we we don't know and a lot of that depends on you know what the experts say I'm not one of them I listen just like everybody else to the news every day and try to understand it and and hopefully you know the diagnosis will rates will go down and and hopefully were on our way to finding successful cures but again that's that's in the hands of the experts and hopefully we get there sooner than later now what are you hearing from your clients that are still open the convenience stores the liquor stores they have that early pantry loading phase which I think everybody thought was gonna continue and it lasted for about two weeks I think people were nervous that that segment of the business could be closed down but those retailers have had they've had issues too they've had issues trying to keep their employees safe they've had issues trying to keep their employees working and and it's been it's been a tough road for them you know we like like a lot of companies scaled back the way that we service those accounts for our own employee safeties or our salespeople are working remotely and not entering the stores they were working you know on the phone with retailers our drivers were making deliveries but not the full scale delivery we were used to because we wanted to limit the amount of time that they had in the account so the accountants had to do a lot more work and we're you know certainly grateful for that everybody wanted to keep their employees safe and everybody was understanding I think I think that's the best part is we're all doing this together and and that goes a long way with people I know you're very involved with the Convention and Visitor's Bureau about the overall impact that this has had on tourism of the valley I think we kind of take for granted and we don't really think about tourism being a big part of the economy but it's it's huge we really appreciate our tourism outside it's probably now more than ever you know whether that's Yankee Candle or Springfield museums or Basketball Hall of Fame or six flags or MGM the biggie all of our tourism assets and that ties back to our restaurants and hotels for occupancy really rive western mass probably more than we thought you know we probably maybe did take a little for granted that we we have you know a lot of outside visitation from from those venues and we we miss them dearly right now and again that that is another area of uncertainty as to when they will come back and it's to spill over the economic impact lost is huge again it goes beyond hotels and restaurants it goes into chops and that's that's what it's really affecting right now and that also is the impact on the tax dollars - I'm sure it is with your business - the the tax revenue that's brought in from from you know whether it's hotel and restaurant taxes or even even you know the bottle bill itself of the money coming back on that sir no there's a big financial impact you know again there's experts behind me trying to figure out we threw this and and what the ramifications are and you know and and you know what impact it has long-lasting a lot of that remains to be seen it's certainly it's it's affected of the economy it's affected a lot of different things but you know the flipside is is safety and that's where the balance has to be and again we'll hopefully start hearing some good news and and and move towards a better place in the near future now as you as you look ahead the impact this may have on your business plan in many ways you know I've heard from a lot of people that we've learned a lot of things about what we can do and this may change our overall outlook as far as how we do business no doubt no doubt and we're very much a part of that we do a leadership call each and every day and it's a big part of you know what type of overall business loss we will suffer it'll be you know significant like everybody else it's no different you don't lose 700 of your 940 accounts and not have substantial business loss and changing the budgets and resources and really taking a new look you know where you're going to be as a company so it's a it's a tough task and and and we discussed it every day with transparency we have the utmost respect for our our retailers and we have the utmost respect for our employees and and we're really trying to work towards a a good balance as well as possible to return everybody to work I suppose the other part of this too is is we all hope that for what we've gone through over the last couple of months that we learned something from this and something good comes from it there's definitely a new norm as we talked about you know people have been working from home remotely there's there's a really good aspects of that there's people who can't wait to come back to the office you know that's uh but yeah you learn oh you've learned a lot it certainly we ever wanted to learn but because we're in this situation we've definitely learned a lot of different ways of communicating you and I are good friends and we're talking to each other through laptops today you know so it's it's changed things but you know maybe in some ways there's there's a level of efficiency the way that we maybe don't have to be in the same room together but on the other hand our business is very much interactive with our customers with our marketing elements were way more than a wholesaler that makes a delivery where we're active and all elements of our retail accounts so we do need to be out there and I can't say enough about our employees who have been out there our drivers or delivery team really interacting on a daily basis with with our customers it's a tremendous team that we have in place that we've been fortunate I've been working with most of the people in our organization for several years and and they're just a tremendous asset we cannot forget that I think the other part of that too is yes we can do stuff like this and over the phone and everything else but there's that element of that one-on-one and I know that's always been a big part of your business with you know in dealing with your clients is is that one-on-one in that trust so you know we can't wait to get back out there you know we are in the people business you know our 940 customers or special events are you know they're samplings that we do and everything that we we do we know our people we miss our we miss our customers it'll be nice to get back in there you know things will be different you know whether it's the way we shake hands or maybe we don't shake hands at all for a while but certainly a face to face business and the respect and the trust has built over years you know this has been an interruption of that but I feel like you know that trust and respect and seeing people we'll get back to some level of new normal and hopefully you know pretty soon I say we're all in this together and hope will come out of this stronger I think we will yeah I think we for sure test that we never wanted to have to have gone for group but since we have we'll definitely learn learn from it many thanks to Anthony Franco for being with me on this week's edition of even better Western Mass before we go I want to offer
