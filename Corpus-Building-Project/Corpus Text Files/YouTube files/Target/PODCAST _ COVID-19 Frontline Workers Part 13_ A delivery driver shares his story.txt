[Music] hi I'm Leo Chang gala and this is the 13th edition of the series frontline workers we talk to courageous essential workers who raise their lives daily to provide important services to the general public it's just over three months since the South African government instituted the National log down on March 27 and almost a month into level 3 from level 4 restaurants and food outlets were only allowed to make use of food delivery services between 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. starting from today people will be allowed to sit in restaurants according to the data portal of statisti the total worth of the online food delivery industry of South Africa was 10.49 billion rand in 2019 and it is predicted to reach seventeen point six billion rand by 2023 with a growth rate of almost fourteen percent annually coming up in this edition of frontline workers to us for drinking delivery services we were under too much pressure because we aren't working in level five so I think we aren't okay to our sides put your food anywhere and I rat you that I've left your photo here or if I'm wait for you when you open the gate I put the foot down and I leave then you pick your food from there I fear because it's not a joke though in the beginning many people used to say that that is for white people that's disease variety not for black barty I myself I believe that anything can happen to me a food delivery driver Denisov who works for uber eat in Johannesburg tells me what he goes through as a frontline worker on average he makes fifteen trips a day and in a week he makes 2,000 rand dennis describes what it's like working under lockdown in the river five things we are not moving because most of the businesses we as Tirion down but to us who are drinking delivery services we were under too much pressure cause we aren't working in level five so I think we aren't okay to our sides since the river is you we allowed in the liver for and level theory at least but now we can earn a living through deliveries job that I am doing in things I don't I can't say that 100% but he at least it's somehow better than level five would you say that you're making money mmm yes I can say that cuz people keeping on ordering food online and since they are doing that for us who are doing deliveries we are earning something just before knockdown uber it's launched a delivery service for essential goods including groceries toiletries and select medication that cannot be purchased and delivered by the app how it I dentist says he lost a lot of income due to not working in level 5 it's affected us a lot but he only are you have to bear with a situation so we used to toe to toe to toe to to save what we had and to use it in a proper way not to be I don't know how I can face it but it affected us a lot they're people that you supported yes I support my family back in Uganda according to government regulations that drivers temperature must be checked before the start of day shift I may not enter the home of a customer if they and the residents are not wearing facemasks Dennis tells us about the safety regulations his company has instituted according to the company marking that is over its we were all instructed to buy sentences to keep our bike screen to buy face masks and grubs so we used our only money to buy all those things to keep us safe but after working for two weeks the company refunded the money we used to buy orders so it generates our company that bought for us Santa's face Messick's graphs and or other tenses that i used to keep us safe in this pandemic do you wear masks and a little helmet when you drive yes you have to put on your mask and the element also you have to sanitize your hands before touching the customers food when you are reaching the customer you have to sentence again your hands and then it give the customer let me study when we are picking orders from the restaurants when I reach the restaurant at first i sanitized my bag then I stand eyes my hands even the restaurant attendants they also do the same in before to their hands then after they handed in my food the food when I reach the customer I Santas again my hands before giving the customer so after Santa's in the hands I pick the customers food I hand it over to the customer and then how many ways can they play before this pandemic there was cash deliveries you can pick a delivery trip from the restaurant then the customer can pay by cash but since we started the since Cannavale has started and the river is allowed to operate again there is no cash deliveries any OPA I think it is a campaign that he decided not to deliver the cash cause it's also another measure of protecting us and a customer not to do with the cash delivery so all orders are paid online we don't deal with any money machine you pay online by your phone we don't have machines cut machines once I pick your order you already paid OPA or the restaurant by your banking up non Takada machines in addition customers must maintain at least a 1.5 meters distance from the delivery personnel if they install the nervous system when up whereby when I reach the customers address I give you a call that um I'm outside your gate either I put your food anywhere and I rat you that I've left your photo here or if I'm wait for you when you open the gate I put the foot down and I leave then you pick your food from there so we keep that by social distancing ourselves there is no hand-to-hand handover to the customer and then with you and the other guys yes they are you see the bites at least there is the three meters from one about to another and we know that he you have to protect yourself or so I don't allow my work comments to touch my bike if a man if I'm standing somewhere I have to be run on my bike so we also practice that food outlets have to ensure that they provide payment options to consumers that are based on reducing risks of transmission they must also put in place collection protocols to ensure that adequate social distancing is maintained by the delivery service personnel when collecting food from the restaurant Dennis says they have to wait outside for the delivery regardless of bad weather if it is a rainy season we use rain rain suits we have them but it's risky when to drive a bike in a rain in during rainfall but if you have some experience like me I work I do even if it is raining I can work also when standing outside as long as you have jackets to keep you warm that's it according to inside survey uber is one of the country's top online ordering platform with a network of approximately 1200 restaurants in Capetown stellenbosch Johannesburg Durban and Pretoria it operates in 100 cities in 27 countries in it Ubah its general you work in any restaurant you just put on your up right now and then they can give you any trip requested from any restaurant so it's not specific that this restaurant and this one once the restaurant is is in Oba they can give you a very very trip from any restaurant and if not oh no in restaurant even in bookshop see exclusive tips in a game Eric over shops we can get all orders from there what other things do delivered groceries yeah but is still online you just buy your grocery maybe from pick and payoff from or game then I get your trip from my app I go and get my pick your grocer and I believe I to your address would you say to drive you back to do the special license to drive it yes we are using licenses if you have a final license maybe if we let me say me I'm from Uganda if I'm to use my driver's license from you god I have to get a traffic register for South Africa if we can get just South African driver's license like me I applied for it and I am using this of the African driver's license uber provides financial assistance to drivers and delivery people diagnosed of covered 1900 order to self quarantine or sub isolated by a doctor or Public Health Authority Dennis says his constant exposure to others is of concern to his loved ones used what about us Bochy you know you have to survive so we had to keep ourselves by practicing all the measures of keeping our life sentences using a mask social distancing like that I fear because it's not a joke though in the beginning many people used to say that that is for white people does this is for white lead not for black barty I myself I believe that anything can happen to me and that fear I can't say that I don't have it I fear the disease that's why I keep all myself protect myself because I know and I believe that it diseases the reality is there any challenges that you're facing day to day with your work yes there are very many challenges cause you know when you're driving a bike it's not like at the same way in your car in a car you're not the body but when you're driving a bike you become their body so in terms of any accident what it's easy for you to loss life than in a car but and even most of the guys when when we are driving on the road people mainly this backs drivers they don't give us respect to and are on the road so when they see us driving they just do stupid things to us that's one of the challenges second sometimes you find that it is difficult to drive in a busy road you may get any order and you have to use highways our bikes are known faster to drive on highways so to avoid that you have to use other alternatives which can cost you a lot of your cozy it becomes a longer distance to reach the customer you may use the fewer of 50 and yet you are delivering an order the customer which is going to pay you 25 grand for the next edition of frontline workers you can visit s abcnews.com or at a CBC News on Twitter Facebook and YouTube for a CBC digital news I'm level
