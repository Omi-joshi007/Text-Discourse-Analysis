foreign [Music] welcome ladies and gentlemen to the mercatus podcast digital grocer episode 33 I'm your host Sylvan Perrier president and CEO of mercatus Technologies and as always joining me in the studio today is Mark fairhurst our senior director of marketing hello everyone Mark it's a beautiful day in Toronto but I will tell you and I think you've noticed because you drove in it's unfortunately really quiet yeah middle of the week and it is like a Sunday morning it is very early and it's not only quiet out in the street is actually very quiet in the Mercedes office that's right and why we are in a work from home mode we are and unfortunately we are being plagued with coronavirus or more commonly known as covid-19 correct so this disease is gripping our nation it has a hold of mankind and our financial markets and the markets are tanking New York State and the province of Ontario are actually surprisingly enough and this is where it gets really scary in a state of emergency Mark have you ever been to New Rochelle no I haven't no a beautiful place but unfortunately it's also under quarantine and San Francisco and United have been talking about this is decreed shelter in place and some other cities may actually do the other the same thing there's talk about New York de Blasio I'm the mayor uh who's wanting to in state the shelter in place but Governor Cuomo has said no effing way there's talk about La I wouldn't be surprised if that's not something our mayor here would want to consider doing considering it's actually one of Canada's largest city there's also an international travel ban it's heavily restricting travel between you know us and Europe Canada Europe and even more importantly most people actually probably don't know this the longest undefended border on the planet between our two countries between our two countries and now it's being restricted to only uh commercial trade yeah it's unprecedented that's for sure yeah and then we're seeing Untold number of financial release Solutions or being injected into the market to calm nerves and to create some form of stability now for the most part we are in Uncharted Territory unless you've gone through parts of 9 11 SARS H1N1 MERS and kind of some of the other types of you know unfortunate issues that have hit mankind you really may not know how to deal with this this is on a scale and not many people who would be listening to this podcast would remember this this is the Spanish Flu of 1918 1919 100 100 and that's why it's affecting the entire planet which is for me it didn't really start sinking in to be honest with you last week I was traveling into the US and I drove multiple existing clients and prospective clients to visit and I decided to drive Kevin Kidder director of uh product was with me and Tim Zimmerman or one of our sales Executives was also with us and it got really real Wednesday Wednesday night the reason it got real Wednesday night I was in a rental I had CNN playing and you could hear just a lack of accountability in the White House and this is not a political show in any case but you could hear the lack of preparedness you could equally get that from our own prime minister here in Canada in terms of the lack of preparedness I think we were seeing more activity at the provincial level and I have to actually comment the premier of uh the French province in Canada Quebec they've been Stellar in their response up to the public and I saw Tim for five minutes Wednesday night his wife who is a vice president for a large marketing firm in Minneapolis she was visiting clients in the Canary Islands and I think it's the minister of Tourism and she flew in through Spain was flying out through Spain and during the White House Press briefing and I was talking to you from the car around nine o'clock Wednesday night yep yeah I remember and remember how the president kind of said they are literally shutting down the Border for people coming in from Europe and he neglected to say with the exception of well Tim calls hey I'm trying to rush my wife back into the country trying to get a flight it's a zoo Delta's not helping I can't get through to them yada yada I said well hold on Tim she's okay she's a U.S citizen she's fine like he's like where are you getting this I was listening to the president talking I said no the state department had to really clarify the rules yeah clarify the rules and there was you know do I want to say the response to this whole issue has been botched yeah I do and I think when we were at NGA you know that's where this the heightened sensitivity of covid-19 really came into play yeah yeah we were talking on the way down on the way down and you came back on the flight the day before me flight attendants were wearing gloves I think they had masks on there were people on the plane wearing masks were you wearing your mask I was not myself no I felt pretty secure in the people that were around me right but I know a colleague of ours Kevin actually he felt very uncomfortable well there were people around him that were sick yeah they were sick I wore my mask the next day on the plane people look at you and you know does the mass really help yes and no if it's an n95 mask to a certain extended thing it protects more people from you versus the opposite but I didn't know whatever I can do to kind of create this safety bubble around me it's all a lot of it's psychological too going back to your point I think this caught a lot of the senior leaders in both countries off guard which is surprising considering the amount of lead time they've had based on the results from Wuhan in China January yeah that's the lead time that we had so covid-19 is having an interesting impact some positive some negative on the retail industry and considering the nature of our podcast and Mark you know this better than I I thought it would be and we've been pondering deciding if we should record this episode a lot of value to our listeners to kind of assemble some information from some trusted sources whether it be Barclays Nielsen the CDC the who people decided to call the who yeah why do we always humanity is this way of dumbing down words now like the who like who is the who the who's a band The Rock Band it's not the World Health Organization no what's his name Doctor Who is it really no okay no I was like oh this guy's taking the job way too seriously and we figured we'd share some of our observations more specifically what's happening in Industry what is the short-term potentially long-term impact and things that we've learned as a digital e-commerce platform provider out in the industry and I will tell you that that moment from that Wednesday to their Friday to the Saturday it was whoa this is woe as not who but it was amazing seeing our senior leaders in our business our processes and really culminate in a way that we could not only support our clients in Industry at the moment but even today and the fact that you know we had already made the provisions back in December I remember this you know at Mercedes we have a senior leadership meeting once a week yeah it's an hour and a half and we talk about governance strategy risks uh in people HR had raised the issue fairly early on towards the end of December right through the in early New Year that this covid-19 we needed to be ready so we had already gone ahead and updated our work from home policy and we immediately were starting to notify our team and we made the call this Thursday night at 7 30 that we'd be advising our team the following day at 2 pm Eastern Standard Time that you were going to be working from home 92 people working from home luckily we had the infrastructure we have the processes we have the back office technology to do this and it's been it's been wonderful I think some of the challenges we're seeing when you do this as a business is the culture and we have a culture that's very um how would I say this what's the right word like you know I think it everyone feeds off everyone else yeah physical the energy yeah and then being in the same physical space yeah physical presence is really key to the ignition behind our culture and I think that and you combine the lack of that and you're when you're confined and you're trying to do some form of social social separation that becomes a challenge so let's just jump into it so the first is a disclaimer we're not disease experts no at all I'm not a doctor I don't think you are not when I last checked no yeah no okay oh my God suddenly he checks tomorrow morning and he's a doctor there are online courses there are yes I you know what the one online course I've always wanted to take was to be either become a pastor or someone that marries people awesome no the only reason I said that because I watched that Friends episode where Joey marries Monica and Chandler oh yes yes yeah that doesn't work here in Canada so yeah it's unfortunate in any case I also do not want to be notary so I don't know who does so Mark I want to ask you some questions okay so but in part of my disclaimer let me backtrack a little bit the best sources are if you're in Canada Health Canada as always public health agency of Canada yeah and then there's in the US the CDC yep and who that's correct right those are the the really the most factual three sources of on covid-19 coronavirus that you will find not the media not Fox News not CNN not your local affiliate not the BBC not ESPN I don't know ESPN not reporting on coronavirus but really not those sources go to those ones those three that we mentioned so Mark what is covid-19 it is a virulent contagious respiratory disease oh wow that's really actually that's not that bad oh okay so covid-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS coronavirus or it's more in the scientific Community it's also known as SARS Dash Cove cov-2 and it's actually in we decided to call it well not we as in you and I uh the community decided to call it coven 19. and it belongs to a broad family of viruses known as Coronavirus now other coronaviruses are actually capable of causing certain types of illnesses as simple as the common cold to something actually more severe much like do you remember MERS yep yep yeah well I lived through SARS I mean yeah in O3 yeah yeah and O3 and because Toronto was sort of like the North American epicenter for it the episode three 12 was mirrors which is the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome a lot worse than SARS in terms of its death rate we didn't necessarily get it here in Canada or in Toronto per se I remember I remember no three when SARS hit our medical infrastructure and systems here was completely unprepared I think we're in better stead now because of the lessons our Public Health Community learned as a result of stars what they did absolutely remember that concert that we had at the end of The Rolling Stones Rolling Stones AC DC Justin Bieber made his big appearance at SARS talk and the fans were lost it on an AC DC had to come out to calm the Crowd Oh my God yeah I suggest you guys Google that okay so now we know a little bit about what is covid-19 or the coronavirus so why the word Coronavirus is that because of the shape of the virus itself damn you're brilliant am I yeah yeah yeah so the word Corona doesn't come from the beer that was my second guess I feel really bad for those the brand managers at Corona so the word was actually introduced by a group of virologists in a this really short article titled coronavirus in News and Views section of nature in this really big book that was published back in November of 1968. and so these guys kind of claims that the characteristic of The Fringe of the virus they were looking at through a microscope was rounded or petal shaped rather than a sharp or pointed compared to some of the other viruses that they were looking at and it had the appearance as you so well said of the solar Corona and so from that point forward the name was used and carried on through for that specific class of viruses so coronavirus in one word it's not two words it's one word so what are the symptoms of covid-19 it's very much like the flu yeah I understand uh yes aches pains fever cough obviously yeah and I know it takes about five days for the symptoms to really come on yeah two to fourteen yeah so you're bang on on those symptoms and you know in some cases you'll see muscle pain mucus production and some sore throats yeah but again that's yeah I missed that one very uncommon and majority of the case results are mild but it can progress to be severe severe pneumonia in some cases multi-organ failure that's scary the heart and the lungs right so who's more at risk to Contracting covid-19 I think the older segment of the population yeah so yeah so everyone's at risk but who's really truly exposed here are people with pre-existing conditions including hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease any anyone that's really taking some sort of immunosuppression medication they are at risk and they're they're kind of saying the stats are really weird again you're not necessarily seeing between the CDC who and health Canada they're not exactly saying well it's people over the age of 60 well you know it's people over the age of 80 doesn't really matter it's those types of individuals that are taking these types of medications or have these side conditions my next question is how is it spread well I know so the new term social distancing you have to keep a certain distance from those around you through cough sneeze I guess any droplets that are in the air and you can actually pick it up from materials Plastics Metals yeah Fabrics and I think the life expectancy of the virus varies depending on the material yeah it does so you're bang on in terms of respiratory droplets that are passed through sneezing or coughing typically in someone that it's normally within six feet of you hence why we're saying Social distancing should be six feet or greater uh in terms of survivability of covid-19 on a Surface whether it's plastic metal or material can vary from an hour to three days it really depends it really depends on the environment I'm going to assume the more humid it is out the longer this stuff mucus doesn't necessarily dry out right well you think about it means Australia is just entering there coming out of their summer that's right right and their cases are spiking just as much as anywhere else well Tom Hanks and his wife yeah yeah right there I think that's what really brought it home to a lot of people I mean it's one time when I remember listening to CNN when they said Tom Hanks has it yeah it's like America's dad is America's dad is like Mr Rogers has covid-19 yeah Mr Rogers is going to die no no he's not and I know he's not isn't he already dead uh yeah yeah Mr Rogers is yes okay good yeah well not good but I'm just like just actually I figured he's already dead now when you touch or if you get some of these droplets on you or you touch one of these Services surfaces with the virus what really causes it to spread or you getting it you're putting your finger and your nose and your mouth or possibly in your eyes on average in an hour how many times does a person touch their face I don't know I think it's between 20 and 30 times on average wow when we were on a conference call I was taking screenshots of some of our colleagues saying they were touching their eyes yeah they're touching their face well it wasn't in their nose no so what are the timelines this discovery of this covid-19 what are the timelines yeah when was it discovered was it uh November yeah November December yeah it depends So within the community of medical experts in China would have been November December considerably later until the country China admitted yeah they're having this issue and it wasn't declared a pandemic until March 11 2020. and in now today we're recording this episode on the 19th of March the number of the cases in the United States I think is it over 8 500 now 40 it's going up well testing is catching significantly significantly right how has covid-19 treated uh inhalers respiratory ventilation yeah well so there's currently no FDA approved medication for covid-19 now so people infected with this virus they receive supportive care right so typically what you would do if you had the flu brass fluids fever control I also heard that you should be taking Tylenol like you should not be taking it's ibuprofen yeah yeah you should be taking what's what's Advil made out of I think that's um the other one the zypreprofen and oscilla salad silic acids I think something like that yeah yeah so Tylenol is the better choice here to kind of help relieve some of the symptoms now for severe cases treatment has to include care to support your vital organs that's why there's it continues to be conversations that we may or may not have enough respirators in Industry you know Elon Musk has kind of gone out and said hey guess what um if we do run out of respirators we're happy to kind of jump in as a as a manufacturer here and start building those out well I know I think it was today that the the president had signed into into order the defense Contracting act basically government telling industry you need to produce this what's commandeering why yes right which hasn't been done since just before the Korean War yeah which is I think is a wonderful thing to do yeah we're seeing cpgs right now jump in you know I don't know if you saw this but Jameson and Ireland suspending one of their lines and they're going to be manufacturing hand sanitizer yeah that's the Distillery The Distillery yeah which I think is great Governor Cuomo decided to act for New York to manufacture its own brand of hand sanitizer and so on right I see a lot of people trying to build those you know make your own at home but the reality is it has to be above 60 alcohol so what should we be doing to protect ourselves staying home staying away I mean if you're sick do not go out into Community right always wash your hands don't touch your face don't touch your face and stay away from the elderly oh that's tough especially you know you know your mom yeah my mom is in a long-term care facility and we talked to her last night but she has no idea this was going on you can't go and visit no no it's lockdown right yep yeah yeah same with my in-laws I mean they can't go out we're actually ordering stuff for them where they live they don't have e-commerce for grocery quite frankly so but luckily UPS delivers for Amazon so we're buying stuff for them online oh great so wash your hands avoid touching your eyes your nose your mouth when you wash your hands you soap and water for at least 15 to 20 seconds I love the CDC it has a video how to wash your hands thank you to the CDC if soap and water are not available use hand sanitizer and has to be at least 60 alcohol cover your coughs your sneezes with a tissue and don't throw then throw the tissue in the trash I thought it was gonna suggested throw it in an incinerator make sure for your household cleaners that you're using at home that they are the ones that are recommended by the CDC I think Lysol Clorox and they have if you can find them in on the shelves if you can find them yes hoarding we got to talk about hoarding that is actually a psychological thing it is yeah it is we'll get to it if you haven't gotten the flu yet and you don't get vaccinated go ahead and get that vaccine for the flu and I'm sorry the anti-vaxxers out there but this is a matter of life and death well it's Community yeah life and death it's the health of the population at Large yeah absolutely absolutely so how is this affecting the retail industry that's what we're here to to really talk about but yeah so for those of you let's let's just jump into it right so for those of you that have may have gone through 911 right so when the two planes hit the Twin Towers the Twin Towers went down and then there was the incident in the middle of Pennsylvania with the plane coming down and then there was a pentagon pentagon right it was a moment of Revelation for us because we had a very clear enemy in this case here you can't easily point you can't point to a virus but the commonality between 9 11 and now is this what is being called nesting right so people lining up to go to grocery stores buying toilet paper buying paper products and so on they're nesting so the effect for grocery retail is kind of interesting because sales are skyrocketing gross revenue will be just through the roof what we saw here at mercatus on Wednesday soon after president Trump speech to the nation which was around nine o'clock Eastern Eastern Standard Time we went from a baseline usage to think it was two to three x traffic immediately Coast to Coast both in Canada United States on the Thursday when the markets opened and the market started to tank and you know financial institutions are talking about concerns about liquidity in the market we saw a run-up compared to our Baseline of 6x now for us that's easy to handle from a technology perspective because the way that we've designed our infrastructure the way that we've designed the architecture of our technology where we host and the fact that we have a modern I.T team called devops that are both operators and developers we're able to Auto scale but we actually mainly have to implement 24-hour shift work we have to increase we use we are we're fully instrumented Mark so we're using tools like New Relic to tell us hey if something's happening the health of a server the CPU consumption memory consumption and so on we'll set off alarms we immediately have to start and we typically can Auto scale a server in under five minutes we actually had to preventively manually Auto scale just to handle the load which is insane explain that so what's the difference between automated and manual process well so if you're not doing it manually where you're saying hey when I reach is an example but let's say I have a Master Slave configuration on my database server and you'll have one master and multiple slaves and means you're Distributing the load of read and writes across those servers so you may set thresholds in your instrumentation to say if I hit 60 percent of connections to my master server or if I'm consuming 80 of my available memory sound an alarm and go ahead and spin up another server Auto replicate the database gotcha that's automated so it happens before you're in a moment of crisis if you don't have that technology no we've seen a lot of Canadian very very large Canadian retailers and some us retailers quite frankly where they could not service their clients the website went went completely dark and likely because they host their own infrastructure it hasn't been designed and they're not using a virtual infrastructure right so they haven't virtualized their operating systems and so on their containers as they're called and so when you're at Peak 100 percent and you have to go spin up another server you have to do that manually you have to provision it then you have to copy data over to it you're introducing a human into something where you don't that becomes that becomes a challenge it ends a risk it was a massive risk because you're under pressure as an individual you need to do this you may miss a step you get somebody breathing down your neck you're losing money now I will say this is where it got really crazy on the Friday we went up 20x to baseline from the baseline from the Baseline on Wednesday by the Friday okay by the Friday but between Wednesday and Friday uh we went 6 12 overnight sixteen by the Friday we were 20x that's insane yeah and we're today we're consistently maintaining two to three acts what would be normal Baseline right the cause and effect on our retailers though those that do click and collect was Labor shortage supply chain issues right on the delivery side and we don't do delivery at mercatus we partner with multiple delivery Partners was the lack of availability of gig economy workers and that's rampant industry wide regardless who the provider is and this is a challenge for the gig economy today I mean we're not even talking about this in this show but it is it's another show and it's it's another show in yourself but like if you have a choice of being healthy and alive and you don't have health care yep that becomes a problem the last thing you want to do is expose yourself to the risk yeah and the additional volume of sales that is coming back into grocery e-commerce or grocery sales in general you have to consider grocery in this world as an essential service right you know versus a Best Buy or versus a you know do you really need to go buy a camcorder no but well we know what's happened in Italy I mean the entire country is on lockdown it's on lockdown and the only retailers that are open are those that do for groceries right and Pharmacy that's right that's right in fact now the new reality when you think of grocery retail it's we're not far from deeming it an essential service and probably along with the internet so retailers immediately are being bombarded by an additional series of transactions both online and in store because people are trading out of restaurant restaurants are closed social distancing yeah and this same effect if you know bars so people are not going to go hang out at the bar at 4 30 to hit happy hour so they're going to the grocery store so it's the shift buying purchases from food away from home too that's right at home 100 so that's going to be great for their Top Line but we're not sure of how much of those dollars will flow through to the bottom simply because the cost of having to bring in more labor and we know at least I've received at least 12 emails from different retailers across the United States looking to hire Frontline staff cleaning staff staff to stock the shelves staff to do work at the distribution center and so on so that's going to have a knock-on effect on margin yeah there is a risk that this also may cause some sort of food inflation meaning that the cost to because of the excess demand the cost to produce the cost of build up prices may go up it's basic law of Economics supply and demand supply and demand now this is where it gets a little trickier and what we saw in 0809 I think we recorded a previous show where we talked about what if we got hit with another recession correct right correct with the retailers that did not properly bounce back out of 0809 suffer if they were ever put into position where there's a lack of liquidity in the market lack of access to trading Co-op and so on and so on and so on so this is where it gets where I think it's going to get close to 0809 let's say we get out of this well yeah we hope we do we hope we do and will it take two weeks three weeks six weeks eight months I'm hearing this I'm hearing numbers as high as 18. yeah I think it could take following other pandemics you know there's going to be a second Spike absolutely and they're estimating in the October November time frame yeah and so I think if I'm at the government right now or the World Health Organization is what we call about flattening that proverbial curve which is really minimizing the impact on the Health Care System you know if you look at New York and Cuomo's been transparent with his numbers he has 56 000 hospital beds and then plus urgent care about blah blah blah all those things if you used to look at the percentage of people that may get hit take a percentage of the people that make a hit that may need to be in the hospital and the ones that need to be on the ventilator there's not enough beds there's not enough ventilators so we talk about flattening the curve and this is why we close bars restaurants social distancing send people to work from home and enact our BCPS right at some point we're gonna get out of this we don't know when the who is probably trying to figure out well how big will the second wave be can we relax the rules at that point regardless of when that is people have overbought you got food in your pantry you got food in your basement there's going to be a certainly a letdown there's going to be a letdown and what you're going to see come out of that is rapid trading out of the channel back we saw the reverse in 0809 people trading at a restaurants back into grocery down from a really high-end grocer down into a lower evil edlp right and from I hate to say it if you couldn't afford an edlp you went into Dollar Store if you couldn't afford a dollar store you were into a food bank yeah yeah but so the effect here with similar to 0809 people will trade right out of grocery they'll go back to Fast Food they'll go back to their higher end Quick Serve restaurant so on and so on and so on and you're going to have a fast food or a food service industry that's going to be desperate to attract that consumer dollar right what we don't know is where does trading Co-op fall into this I know that some retailers have suspended printing their Flyers right on average flyer production is 50 of a marketing budget there's some retailers right now we're leading up to Easter I haven't seen any promotional activity in some stores that I've been to and I've visited quite a few stores in the greater Toronto area where they are not activating some of their promotions because it's let's just get stuff on the shelves at this point the reality is FMI has always talked about that at some point x percent of people in the United States will be using e-commerce by 2025. it will represent I think the number was was it 100 billion I can't 100 billion yep it was something like that in Canada it's considerably lower yep I think we probably we're going to get to that number much sooner basically um e-commerce was on fire but this is like an accelerant oh my God yeah I hate to say it if you're in the business of e-commerce platforms it's great yeah great for you to a certain extent I think some people will have a hard time switching back out of e-commerce due to fear will stay in that channel if you're a grocery teller and you've not invested in owning your platform guess what you've accelerated someone else yep owning the relationship yeah that's a big concern for some mercatus because you know we have been consistent in our messaging to the market about being honest with the retailer as to what was really happening in that shopping relationship right and you're right this is this is a huge risk to that long-term relationship yeah an example on the Friday in three of our markets are likely having some challenge in being serviced by delivery and we had in the space of 20 minutes 10 000 new accounts being created that's insane yeah it was ridiculous I'm like who are these existing customers what's going on is this the buggers and it wasn't is literally 10 000 people that came through coast to coast in a space of 20 minutes creating new accounts wanting to buy online wow so I think if you're a retailer and you've not invested in owning the relationship and billing out your platform trust me this is something that you need to be extremely mindful this will be the new normal yeah you know we've had conversations identifying there are those retailers who understand where e-commerce fits strategically and those that don't right this if anything has the attention of the c-suite there's no avoiding it at this point in time now is the time to actually plan and solidify that strategy yeah so yesterday there was a question on LinkedIn that was are some retailers actually and I'm probably going to get this wrong but there are some retailers actually leaving items on their websites for sale although they may not be carrying them in in the store are they doing this in a way to transition their customers from in-store to online right you saw my response yep I said no it was the quickest response I didn't elaborate I didn't want to elaborate anything I needed to elaborate let everyone else elaborate the reality is is that in when you understand modern technology and you've used modern technology there are some cases that some of the retail systems that are out there have no availability to present real-time inventory levels at an individual store back out to a platform back out to the website quite frankly very few of some of the retailers that are out there in the industry can do that and so we offer multiple mechanisms in our platform that could be when you upload your data to us on a nightly basis set your maximum minimum thresholds on an individual SKU if you run out of a product inside of a store you can log into your console application and de-list a product right so so we have the traditional way of doing it you know through an interface and then there's the more modern way of doing it through a data feed there's also the capability in our platform to do it through a web service right right right but when you're overrun with so many issues in the business dealing with lack of availability inside brick and mortar labor issues the health and wellness of your employees it just it unfortunately fell off to the Wayside now I'm not saying that this is something that will continue like this in in the long run but just understand that this is what essentially uh transpired so Mark do you know why people hoard are you trying to tell me something no I'm not are you a hoarder Mark I don't think so okay I do have a room in my house it's kind of messy no it's not the junk room right have you gone from a junk drawer to a junk room yeah oh that's not good it's the room in the house where you move I have this Vision now I'm going to be rescuing you out of a home with piles of stuff everywhere and Aaron cats yeah just a hand sticking up from this pile of paper cats chewing on my your beer your beetles crackly an eye patch but I might give you an eye patch but I'm scared of the dark yes so yes so there is a room that's messy anyways we're getting off top yeah yeah so what defines a hardest so there's Professor here of U of T and he kind of explains it really interesting when it comes to toilet paper so going to the bathroom is is something vile and Primal at the same time and the sense of having access to paper the curtails no but nobody can explain this to curtail it why the fascination with toilet paper this is not a curtail it gives you in a moment of drastic gives you a sense of comfort that's one side of it okay the other equation is we're very perception through our eyes and our emotions when we see other people in a frenzy buying we just jump in and mimic God you remember when the Cabbage Patch came out you're as old as I am yeah yes do you remember people fighting over yeah like some of these women the body have kids like you know fist fights in Kmart for Kmart where's Martha Stewart when you need her where is Martha sir she hunkered gowns for this she's hoarding you know Martha there's a book idea for you what to do with toilet paper some great crafts right anyways just an idea I will I was at Costco and yeah I pulled it off this kid Yeah well yeah I bet she did so in any case let's talk about some of the questions that we got so this is from Raul so why did some retailers website crash so I'll take this one so you know the harsh reality becomes planning infrastructure management architecture and having the right people that understands scalability and being able to act in a moment's notice and also this is stuff you have to rehearse so you just don't wake up one morning and say I'm gonna set up a bunch of servers and I'm going to license out a piece of technology or we're going to build something for our business and then suddenly you know you don't think of these things you have to plan this out there's also you know the difference between building anointing it yourself right and then using you know a scalable headless Commerce solution well absolutely right I'm sorry yeah that's why you pay a monthly licensing fees to pay an expert who understands how to do this it's called specialization and that's yeah and that's why you have you know an SLA in case something happens that's why you have an application support team that's why you have an 800 number you can dial that's why you hire these teams to worry about that while you're more worried about everything else right if I could give advice don't ever pretend you're something that you're not right be good at what you're good at which is being a you know class a retailer I don't pretend to be a lawyer I have access to a lawyer I tend to be an accountant I have an accountant yep so this is from John why are there items for sale on the Retailer's website but not available in store we already tackle that one Alex we sent a question why can't I get a confirmed delivery time slot interesting well that's the reality is there is not an available resource yeah same if you're doing click and collect if you can't get access to be able to pick up your groceries between two and four likely the time slots have been maximized really comes down to Resource availability to be able to support that this one's from Jack Wire stores running out of products supply and demand it's really that simple so this one is from Cindy why are people hoarding toilet paper so we talked about that right she said it's the least appealing bodily function I don't understand why people are ordering it we talked about it and Louise I gotta let you tackle this one is this an opportunity to build loyalty or is it too little too late in if you don't already have a good customer experience in place my response is absolutely I mean this in situations like this where e-commerce is becoming ever more vital to the shopping experience it's never too late but the retailer has to be able to control that relationship yeah bring that Shopper back into your business and don't Outsource them but you got to start you have to start somewhere right this has been a great episode yeah I've enjoyed this yeah this has been this is double the time that we normally record well let's look at it this way people are at home they have a little more time to listen
