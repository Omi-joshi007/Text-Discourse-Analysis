hello everyone around the world welcome to have a virtual event on how our food business is coping with kovat 19 and its aftermath I am Roger Pangaea lodge I am director for communications and public affairs at f3 and I'll be moderating this event this event will focus on how private food sector operators are responding to the curve in 19 crises much of the focus is on the public health responses but food supply chains are operated by private operators amidst all this uncertainty how are they responding to both the massive demand and supply shocks the curve 8:19 is provoking two food systems and how are they managing to keep supply chains operational well the adjustments they are making be just temporary or lasting do they see opportunities in this crisis to change business models such that they did not only create resilience to the impacts of Kobe 19 but also to the other pressing challenges to food systems such as climate change and poor diets thank you for joining our virtual event we are eager to hear from all of you and to participate in our Q&A session that you'll follow the brief presentations please submit your questions using the chat box you can follow the conversation on Twitter that's the hashtag if pre live and you can post questions on twitter by using hashtag ask if Bri you can post your questions at any time we have an exciting program lined up for you and without further ado I'd like to begin by calling on us women the director-general of if brief for his introductory remarks yo over to you thank you very much Rachel good morning good evening wherever you are it's a great pleasure for me great honor to chair this panel I'm very excited also to do so I think it's going to be very insightful event again and I would like to start to start I would like to thank Rob Foss who is the director of our markets and trade division at if prefer putting together this excellent set of speakers in the past weeks and months we've had a lot of events right at if pre only related to go bird and food security and global food systems we have had special sessions talking about poverty issues nutrition issues food systems gender aspects social programs etc and so today we are focusing on the role of the private sector and that is very important because the private sector makes up a big share of our food systems and particularly of our food supply systems we know that ghovat 19 has had a major impact on on the global food systems and essentially it comes through two major mechanisms one is it has caused a major economic recession a lot of people have lost their jobs have lost their incomes companies have gone bankrupt etc and this has reduced income and therefore people can no longer afford to buy the types of food they about before a second major element is the disruption of our food supply systems or food systems and these disruptions are very severe and here we see that unlike for example the what happened in 2007-2008 with the food price spikes in global markets is that in this case everybody is hurt so the consumers are hurt because their supply of food has reduced there may be no food or little food and at higher prices but at the same time the farmers are also suffering because they cannot sell their food and so their price are actually going down while the consumer prices are going up and there is local surpluses and of course many people work in the food system in small or large companies and so they have lost their jobs and their incomes as well as many of these people are poor now it's also true though that not all supply systems have done so poorly ok several of the supplied systems in the world have held up pretty well ok and as big a lesson as we can draw on the vulnerability of some of our supply system we should also draw lessons on the heterogeneity that some have done much better and have been much more resilient to the changes now these differences are not random ok particularly the role of labour in some aspects of the food system is very important and particularly the labor dense elements of some of the supply chains those that's where the problems have concentrated and so typically that's also why we see that in developing countries where supply systems are typically more labor dense they're the problems are larger than in rich countries but also in rich countries that have been significant problem think about reduced access to hired labor for processing or for harvesting or the problems in for example the US and the German meat processing facilities within the developing countries we see roughly that the global value chains have held up somewhat better than than the local value chains and there we see differences between a lot of the other meats which are present there they are labor-intensive but at the same time they use a lot of family labor okay which is less affected by the lockdowns and at the same time the larger companies or more capital-intensive more labor-intensive but at the sorry more knowledge intensive less labor-intensive but they their labour is all higher flavor which is affected by the logger so we see very mixed effect even within the different change there I think most of most intriguingly right now is what's happening in terms of fixing them trying to make them more resilient dealing with the problems and we know from ad-hoc discussions that there is a lot going on in the field a lot of entrepreneurship a lot of innovations that are taking place to make the private value chains more resilient yes there is also a lot of innovation in the public systems as well and so today I really look forward to hearing from people from the private sectors who are in the field to hear what they are trying to do how they are trying to introduce innovations to make their systems more resilient and what I also heard from talking to people in the field have said that you know some of the changes we're making now we were thinking about with introducing in 15 years maybe two decades and suddenly everything is going at a very high very intense speed much more than we had anticipated so I really look forward to hearing from our panelists about what they are doing and how they see the developments in the coming months and even beyond that thank you very much you know thank you very much for your remarks for setting the stage for the event today and I'm sure we'll come back to you later on for further discussion on the lessons to learn so let me move to have a next speaker who is nameko Iike guano the mecca is the founder and the CEO of cold hubs Nigeria cold hubs is a social enterprise that runs solar-powered storage facilities in various parts of Nigeria that allows farmers and traders to properly handle and store fruits and vegetables reduce food loss and waste and improve incomes of farmers and traders as well of the women who managed the solar-powered storage units no Mecca our questions are for you as follows how is your business faring during KOed 19 in many parts of Africa we are seeing supply disruptions and food losses especially for perishable foods like fruits and vegetables the demand for your services must have gone up or has it not what adjustments are you making to continue and to scale up your operations they may have a look forward to hearing from you so over to you thank you good morning good afternoon good evening viewers from all across the world my name is in the motika guano and prior to convey lockdown we had 24 operational code hubs all across Nigeria we had about 3000 517 customers we were actually building 30 new code rooms in different forms produce aggregation centers and outdoor markets but during co feed we had only about six of our code hubs open and operational but the six code who have signed up about 32 new customers you know so we had a lot of lessons that we learned but why did we reduce from 24 to 6 new code hubs are six columns of freshener yeah next slide please we actually came down to six or personal code hubs because in the month of March suddenly there was a national announcement saying that public places were all closed down including our markets and we incidentally strategically situated our solar-powered code rooms inside markets inside the food markets but those food markets we're all closed down because you can have a typical food market in Nigeria where two thousand people come in every day for buying and selling boxes so the government felt it would be wise to close down those food markets so suddenly most of the markets where we had our presence we're actually closed down that's like so you have a market like relief market where we have more than 300 customers all closed down so what we had was the full sellers and retailers moved outside the market they stand on the fence of the market and they do their daily trading and you also had consumers who come to buy but in the midst of the market closure we had a new difficulty and that difficulty was actually a national announcement stopping interstate movement so different states actually closed their borders next slide so the closure of borders all across Nigeria limited the availability of food from coming from the high production clusters to the high consumption clusters so you have a situation where a truck bringing in oranges actually dropped oranges because the truck cannot get into the delivery stage you know so that happened all across Nigeria trucks were being stopped because there were there was a lot of law enforcement on the road preventing them there was a lot of announcements you know so at the first few weeks there were a lot of announcements and we didn't know what was going on but you know by the amount of Mayor gradually people started to understand what was actually going on the Jews and then not reduce yeah less likely so part of the announcement was that they the closure of public places does not affect from clusters and produce aggregation centers so we actually opened our code rooms in those sites and we saw increased storage because over a period of time there was a lot of farmers who actually need that storage they found it difficult they actually evacuated their goods from the farms to the markets because most of the matter is were closed and most of the truck drivers found it really difficult to actually go to those firms to move commodities out because the roads were blocked there were police and law other law enforcement checkpoints that we are preventing that interstate movement so increased storage at our farm cross besides significant I mean between seventy to hundred percent utilization rates we record it in the six code Hobbs that were situated in the farms and ours oppression up next slide please that increased storage continued some days we get more than 150 crates our code rooms are designed 450 crates so there were some days where we got 170 980 crates he shows that propensity to store by people who have for quite a period of time harvested and where we tend to evacuate their goods next slide so we also saw a lot of need for a refrigerated van you know everyone was actually calling us and you actually helped us a goods from the farms you know because we have this relationship with most government local governments we had a lot of need for our refrigerated van but we had one small van that can only take up to three tons of food but we also lent and that is how actually how we are positioning the growth of our company post co feed and on the next slide I will talk about that a little bit more that's like so post copy what we've now seen that in those from clusters where we have three ponds taller powered coal storage we are going to increase them to paint on solar power to storage guys need for coal storage in those form clusters that can take a significant amount of food but in addition to those solar-powered crude rooms we are going to attach every solar-powered crude room to attempt on refrigerated truck that can actually go in and evacuate that food and bring it to the market we will still maintain our treatments in outdoor markets the markets are still not open but there has been a relaxation of all the rules and that's what we are planning as code our postcode feet next slide and that is all from me I'm just showing you this picture of what our urban markets looks like it is really massive so the government quickly had to close all the markets they are still closed and we have our tiny Co table there each day such markets receive between 2,000 to 5,000 people thank you very much I'm available to answer some of your questions Thank You America thank you so much for sharing with us the experience in Nigeria and how you're pivoting and positioning your business I'm sure we'll come back to that in the Q&A session to learn more about how that's happening let me turn to our next speaker who is Robert a'ready who is the executive vice president for foods at Unilever Robert what disruptions is your company facing in supply chains and in the demand for food how is Unilever adjusting what actions are you taking in your supply chains how is this impacting your innovation plans and are you expecting that co 819 will have lasting impacts on the nature of food demand and hence on your business Robert we look forward to your remarks over to you everybody let's go to the to the first chart please so let me take you through some of the year the impacts that we saw across our supply chain and I don't think they are really a lot different than what many other players suffered in in the scheme of things of course the first thing that was confronting was this import and export restrictions you know countries closing down borders partly also because they wanted to make sure that they kept the foods for themselves lucky this didn't last too long because we're people also sit on something they also have a desire for something so there was a need for trade and we were able with quite some good support from NGOs and my WEF to quickly unlock borders to to help that that supply came through again we also serve government's taking measures in terms of closing down all non-essential sites and it's of course quite debatable whether a mayonnaise plant or ice cream plant is essential or not but also there after a first let's say weeks of uncertainty when we were able to show the you know the strict hygiene measures that we were putting in place in our factories it was quite a doable to then open up the essential science again the bigger challenge was indeed the shortage of workforce not only because we saw that people were falling ill but also because some people were afraid to come to work or had difficulties to come to work we literally organized taxi transports to help factories come to workers we move factory where factory workers from for instance an ice cream plant which there was less demand for towards food plants and we even had people in some cases sleeping in the factory simply because the risk of the transport was bigger than the uncomfort of having to stay in the factory naturally we saw some major changes in buying behaviour and I'll come to that in one of the next chart and the biggest skellige was probably the need to unlock the sudden capacity that was coming our way we saw that the out of home channel was immediately closed and there was a huge force of out of home consumption moving to a vegan home and even some consumer panic in certain markets where people were simply just buying all the food that they could get I think we were wise to at least in a very quick stage immediately decide that we would cut 65% of our portfolio so we had our factories only focusing on the top 35 percent of our items and that literally helped us to secure the supply for for that for those for those items and maybe we tend to forget sometimes but not all people working in supply chain work for a factory of course so we also saw a lot of planners and procurement people having to work suddenly from their attic or garage and having to connect with the world to secure more raw materials more packaging materials to fulfilling the demands next chart please I think the first thing that we said is where was our priority was all about people in safety so we put in place tier 4 measures across all our factories and with that we were able to keep 99% of our global factories open we did a very deliberate thing to also pull out the heroes of these people that were working in the frontline remember that in the media at the time we were seeing a lot about little workers etc in our own internal organization we were really hearing in the people that we're leaving the relative safety of their home to work and to mend the lines and to make sure that the food supply was coming through and lastly you know for the large majority of the office workers that were now suddenly first work from home we were very attentive and very appreciative that they needed to combine their family life with their office life so suddenly we saw that people had to balance between teaching and homeschooling their kids but also being joining in meetings and picking up the additional pieces of work and we were sharing a lot of best practices on that next chart please once we had taken care of our people we decided that we also had a role to play in communities and there were variety of activities that we took across the globe in totality we have donated more than a hundred million euros of goods and we're still counting and we also gave close to half a billion of credit to those customers and suppliers who are in need in order to that the business could continue to thrive but also some nice local examples like using our R&D facility in the UK to build respirators for hospitals or for instance this example in Brazil where the Heineken plant was closed because it was a non-essential factory but their factory workers came to the University to actually help us produce more hand sanitizers so really trying to be flexible and putting the people in place where we could make the most out of that next chart please then about consumer demand what do we see of course we saw a massive shift from channels that were looked out or found to be unsafe towards channels where people could buy so we saw this massive shift to supermarkets leading to out of stocks we saw of course ecommerce taking a big boost and even cashing carry which in many markets opened up for the public in order to help to serve that demand but also changes in consumer behavior suddenly people were all forced to put all the home consumption from inside their home there were no more takeaway meals no more restaurants to be opened so we started to inspire consumers what to cook at home how to cook healthy meals how to stay inspired but we also saw a rising demands and we still see that there's an increased demand for healthy food for immunity propositions people are trying to improve their health and to boost their immunity to face this virus and any other potential diseases coming up and of course as we are a branded manufacturer we put a lot of effort from our brands and the messaging that we wanted to convey we are a brand or a company that believes in purpose and this was of course in that sense also a moment that our brands needed to really stand up and be focal whether it was about Dolf thinking the frontline workers in hospitals or indeed our ice cream business - you know in a humorous way but tell people to stay apart but to speak together next chart please but if one thing should come from covet I personally hope that it will be a change for our food systems we need a food system that is much more inclusive a much more sustainable than it is today and I think kovat gave us a shot in the food systems and we need to make sure that we now take the right kind of actions and take it forward in the right manner if we want to localize everything which is this first feeling of protectiveness let us protect ourselves we have to watch out because we have a billion people in the world more than a billion are obese and almost a billion are going to bed hungry every day we need to form a supply or a food system that is able to be more inclusive from small or foreigners up and we need a food system which is much more sustainable we're eating roughly 75% of our food from 12 plants and five animal species only that is not enough biodiversity our earth will not be able to regenerate itself like that so we need to change that and that is why two weeks ago Unilever has stepped up to it another commitment we will invest another billion euros over the next ten years in this Climate Fund to help to drive some of these changes and I would like to call on everybody in this call to us to take on I don't want you know normally we are a bit of a verse that competition does the same this is where I would want everybody to join in because we need to do we need to do this as one collective to come to the system that is my hope that at least this kovat situation is bringing us also a perfecter good thank you yeah and then maybe for my last chart the good news is Cove it will pass but purposes forever thank you very much Robert thank you very much very much appreciated your presentation and I know we will come back to you and the Q&A for further elaboration especially Lawrence thank you our next speaker is Steven Bartholomew's who is the policy director of food industries Asia Steven you work with a huge network of large food companies that operate in Asia what are you hearing from these companies regarding how they addressing this crisis how are they adjusting to protect the integrity of their supply chains and are they seeking collaboration through food industries Asia what kind of policy support are these businesses in your network seeking to make the supply chains more resilient Steven you look we look forward to your remarks over to you thank you very much and good evening good morning to all of you who are joining this call delighted to be on this call and thank you very much for you for giving me this opportunity to be on the call as well I think I'll start by saying that across Asia and this is based on two studies that we've carried out one in April the end of March April and the other end of April and May where we looked at the impact of Kobe 19 on food security Asia and we also looked at the impact of Kobe 19 on price pressure across Asia the good news from both of these studies is that the food supply chain in Asia has been remarkably resilient given the challenges that we have faced and the challenges have been quite monumental obviously you know you've had government restrictions lock downs etc border closures closures and this has had both a direct and an indirect impact on the industry and we've seen shox both on the supply side as well as on the demand side as the previous speaker alluded to I think one of the biggest challenges that industry has faced here in Asia has been related to labor shortages input shortages and border challenges I think this has come about largely in terms which we look and input challenges or if you look at labor shortages in some markets in Asia you're just not manufacturing for that particular cut you're you're manufacturing for the region and if you take the food value chain it takes various inputs to eventually produce the food that you need and our role really as an industry association has been to carry out this research in partnership with organizations like PwC and Oxford Economics where we can use this data to actually inform government policy on the demand side we've seen very similar issues as you have seen across the world and that's things like an equine foodservice restrictions as well as reduced consumer confidence and spending power a lot of the labor force in Asia are paid on a daily basis and for a lot of these daily wage earners it's been a huge challenge a lot of them have lost their jobs or in some markets where there have been restrictions where you can only have about fifty percent of the labor force show up to work this has been a tremendous challenge but as I said the business and the businesses that we work with have been remarkably resilient in the face of these challenges and [Music] businesses also must follow mitigation steps as we move forward if you if we are to recover from this crisis and we see this as as three steps if you like stabilize improve and to refocus and reposition current we stabilized stage was really the first couple of months following the announcement of the pandemic where we saw things like crisis management taking place and we've kind of now moved in if you like to the improve phase they are we're seeing rapid improvements in business performance and this is driven by rapid cost reduction as well as sustainable capital management going forward however when we look to refocus and reposition our businesses and that is in the next sort of 6 to 12 months the big challenges are going to be around supply chain management and looking at your supply chain across Asia a lot of the the inputs that I spoke of earlier are coming from various sources across the region and dependency on one geography a hazard an impact on several of the members and the companies that we have worked with so it's been a stretch so a sharp learning curve for a lot of industry players where they've had to really pivot and shift and look at how they manage their supply chains and how we move this forward I think it's important to look at small holders and how some of these large companies work with small holders because if you take Asia more than 60% of the agricultural input comes from small holders so they play a very critical part in the way that we operate I think finally I'd like to say that I mean it's a no-brainer about the impacts of cobia on our industry will last long and beyond the current crisis so some of the things that we are seeing here in Asia for example also accelerated consumer trends we've seen more and more consumers going into online shopping across Asia the amount of online shopping has increased exponentially across the region we are also seeing a push for more and more digitalization where companies are looking at their operations and trying to figure out do we really first of all need the sort of label forces that we need and do we move to more high-value jobs they are using things like artificial intelligence but I think really where we are going to see a lot of big changes is around supply and this is where you will need a combination of both localized as well as regional and diversify planes to manage this crisis and then finally it will all be about integrated building an understanding and resilience moving forward so I'll stop there but I'd be happy to take questions and also add some additional comments to thank you thank you very much Steven and we will definitely come back to you later on during the Q&A before I come to our next speaker I'd like to remind all of you watching our event that you can submit your brief questions in the chat box we will be coming to the Q&A session soon so please do start submitting your questions and our next speaker is Tom Reardon tom is well known to all of us Thomas prophets of agricultural food and Resource Economics at Michigan State University MSU Tom you've written a lot about food supply chains and how they are rapidly changing around the world especially in low-income Africa and South Asia you have emphasized the enormous dynamics of especially small and medium sized food processing trading and retail businesses in what you're calling the hidden middle of the food system so is Co 819 changing any of these dynamics what are the main changes innovations you're seeing in food supply chains because of co-ed 19 will these changes be lasting and what should government's be doing to improve the resilience of supply chains and hence the survival chances of small businesses tell me look forward to your remarks over to you Tommi a muted yes can you hear me no yes thank thank you very much I'll speak first about food supply chain characteristics in developing countries just before open 19 because I think it's very crucial context to be able to understand what are the impacts on the system now then I'll talk about codes impacts on the different nodes or segments of the food supply chains and then I'll briefly discuss specific input impacts and responses of large companies and especially of SME small and medium enterprises first before coated and now food supply chains in developing countries are extremely important to national food security this is seen in the huge importance of the share of purchases in national food consumption I think these are surprising numbers in Africa eighty percent of all food consumption is purchased 80% in India 92% in Africa and India 60% of all food consumption is done in cities in urban areas and of the 40% of national food consumption that's in rural areas 50% is purchased in Africa only 20% of food comes from subsistence farming in India only 8% so we really have a commercialized food system in these poor regions 99% of the food markets are operated by the private sector small and large only 1% is operated by government so governments and donors are not going to be able to even get near replacing what markets are doing in this crisis in African India 80% 80% of the food supply chains are operated by small and medium enterprises large companies are at most 20% so there's just emerging their small slice of the pie but people are not focusing much on what is that 80% doing the small and medium enterprises so my first message is that food markets are extremely important to food security and by far the main players are the small and medium enterprises second kovetz main impacts on food supply chains have been mainly on downstream and midstream enterprises with most impact on the retail and food service sector and the second level impact on wholesale logistics and processing at least on the farm sector although among farmers the impact is more of those who hire a lot of labour and that's much more in India than in Africa third large companies have been affected much less than small enterprises by cofee large companies have are more capital and less labor-intensive they have more diversified in extensive procurement supply chains with more options and alternatives they have more inventory and cash to draw on they can shift more to supplying their existing supermarket clients they can focus their business on core products to weather the storm yet still Colvin has heard operations they've responded by diversifying their procurement sources busing in workers going more digital shifting toward more use of mobile money ecommerce and e-procurement ecommerce companies like Alibaba sub flip card in India Jamia in Africa have had large increases in their business during this time and the acceleration of e-commerce in developing countries is likely to last well beyond covin fourth small and medium enterprises have been most affected by cope it hit by mobility restrictions of workers and clients drops in demand and input shortages for example egg retailers in Nigeria lost half their business in a couple months feed mills had to dial down their output due to worker and input shortages fishermen and Malaysia couldn't get fish to market wholesalers in India couldn't find truckers street vendors and small restaurants and small shops all over these regions have found their in person customers disappearing fast but far from staying just victims the already dynamic small and medium enterprise sector that was blossoming and burgeoning before kovin has strategic recently responded and adapted to the crisis by and large and many of the adaptations are I think here to stay first owners of small and medium enterprises have diversified their product lines for example shifting toward adding volume such as processing value such as processing for longer shelf-life second small firms have changed the composition of their inputs and diversified their sourcing arrangements just as we see large companies have for example Nigeria feed Millers have shifted more toward non important inputs third SMEs have increased their use of contactless tile online banking and mobile money to keep business flowing fourth small enterprises have rushed toward the use of e-commerce let me dwell on this for a second logistics firms associate patience sometimes in collaboration with governments such as in India China have started or intensified the use of eep platforms to link and to find and link truckers to suppliers and retailers wholesale markets have adopted a platforms to link wholesale markets and wholesalers with retailers in some cases this has been in partnership with e-commerce companies for example in Myanmar the bean impulse wholesaler Association set up an e platform a few weeks after povedilla as did the produce wholesaler Association of China and the fish wholesale market in Oman retailers and food service small and medium enterprises have started to partner with e-commerce and delivery startup small enterprises so small with small that have spread quickly during kovat to resume business with their clients some of this ecommerce resilience strategies has been small enterprises in retail and food service with small enterprises in commerce and delivery logistics for example in Thailand fishermen have partnered with an SME platform a platform and delivery companies to reach their clients for which they had been at first cut off a bike ovid another example is in India were swiggy a provider of e-commerce and delivery services for SME restaurants scaled up its operation and bundled it with a credit program for its clients to restart their business and bounce back from covet as well as giving them hygiene training and supplies in addition to the loan program some of this ecommerce resilience strategy has been SMEs in food supply and retail and food service partnering with large companies such as Alibaba to Mia and Africa Flipkart in India these have worked with SME retailers and independent supermarkets to set up hyper global delivery to get their resumption of service going to their customers as well as link to their suppliers so large companies large e-commerce companies with small companies in some businesses in devel regions be they small or large have not taken covet lying down it's hit them it's hurt them but they're deployed deployed an array of strategic responses that I think will be enduring business practices in the recovery and postcode period thank you Tom thank you so much fascinating remarks fascinating numbers you shared with us at the beginning I'm sure we'll come back to that in the Q&A we are now in the Q&A part of the program so I do invite colleagues from around the world please do submit your questions using the various chat boxes various modalities we have and we are eager to receive them please feel free to share your name institution if you wish and as a reminder you can also submit them on twitter using the hashtag ask if free I will read one question at a time and I will direct it to a relevant speaker and in some instances and in the interest of time I may consolidate some of the questions I will also call on your Sue Ellen and Rob was the two organizers of the event today in a few minutes for any questions that they may have so a heads up to them to stay tuned to ask the panelists any questions but let me now start taking the questions that are coming in from online and the first question I would like to direct to you know Mecca this question is coming in from RT Bok ideale with the Lagos State Government in Nigeria and the question is as follows covet 19 outbreak has awakened awareness on nutrition but not on hygiene the hygienic approach is a great challenge for smallholder farmers how do we mitigate the hygienic processing of food what will work for processors in the new system that demands a change of approach especially towards more hygienic they Mecca over to you any comments on that question thank you very much for that question I think the is obvious that small holder farmers needs a lot of education and that education has to be at the peace and in the language that they understand you know there needs to be education around hygiene that needs to be education around process field and to be education around packaging and handling of food you know a la special enterprise developed a whole suit of post-harvest management education suited for smallholder farmers in the different languages of Nigeria and in comic book format to make it more entertaining you know but what we've discovered in the course of delivering the education you still need more education because you have people who have practice agriculture for more than four to six decades that do not have direct with its skill the only skill inherent those skills that we use for food production only and as they are focused and we are trying to make them think outside production to see that there is added value from production that needs to be education thank you new Mecca oh sure we'll come back to you later on but let me direct the next question to both her Robert and to Steven this question is coming in what to our speakers representing food businesses see as the topmost role of government at this time of economic reopening amid the covert 19 pandemic let me ask her Robert first and then ever come to Steven what do you see as a topmost role of government Robert yeah good question I think we already in the beginning the first reaction was to close borders we have to really realize that if we want to make food accessible to everybody globally we need a global food chain so we need to make sure that governments stimulate that openness and stimulate that we can move to an efficient and a sustainable supply chain and food system so that would be my first and foremost and of course I think ensuring that there is safety and fairness in all the work that's being done in terms of circumstances and in terms of the way how we produce food and she wouldn't set cetera that would be my might be in my collab thank you Robert let me come to Stephen next thank you that is a good question and it's actually a question that we did ask some of the food industry companies that were surveyed in a in the study that was done by PwC in partnership with food industry Asia and I think that the thing that is critical because we did see issues related to this in many markets across Asia is that I think the overarching for me point is that there needs to be a recognition of the food supply chain the whole food supply chain as an essential service we saw this we saw numerous challenges here in Asia where our governments would not recognize one particular component just take something like packaging right food packaging it's critical to get your food safely to your consumers but if a particular government doesn't see a packaging company or company that manufactures packaging material as an essential service that becomes a huge problem so I think the first and most important point is the recognition of the food supply chain as an essential service I think the other challenges that we saw here in Asia and what food companies said was critical in terms of government policies going forward is first of all the protection of the labor supply and this is ensuring that people can get to work because for a lot of manufacturing it's labor intensive I think that we've also looking at issues such as preservation of cross-border trade we had some governments here in Asia closing our borders and also going into protectionism you know we have Vietnam that for a few weeks stopped the export of rice and going forward if you have these kinds of measures where governments when it comes to food security if they move on to if you like the other side of the fence it's sort of protectionism nationalism and focusing or just sort of stockpiling stuff but not anything at the whole would trade then that becomes a challenge so I think that it's critical that the supply chain has to be looked at Stickley my government's certainly here in asia thank you thank you thank you very much Steven you let me come over to you I'm sure that the panelists have raised some very interesting questions in your mind so perhaps you'd like to direct one or two or three of them over to you you yeah I raised a lot of questions but I learned a lot as well so just a few let me ask a few short questions on for each of them maybe so I was really intrigued by numark last story about basically the shift in the gold hub investment from the markets to the farmer clusters and so and with the with it basically the refrigerated trucks etc and so my question to him is whether he sees this as a fundamental shift that will remain after the corporate crisis and this is like a major kind of structural change that will he expects to stay there or that this was just be temporary in this mind for Robert and Steve and my question would be to link it a bit their story a bit with Tom's presentation where Tom has really identified some of the institutional changes that are going on in the supply chains and whether they can reflect on that a bit and give maybe some examples of how what has happened in within their companies or their industry what they see us as crucial changes have taken place also linking with the small holders for example and which are supplying to them and my question to tom is that I mean tom is given a great story in terms of the big patterns that is see and so I mean in my questions forever how important are these trends in and for example poorer countries in Africa and India I know and China there now I understand there's a billion people who are online okay and so Alibaba is even very present in rural areas but there seems to be that in poorer countries this may be less still developed and so my question is how relevant is this also for these poorer countries thank you thank you yo let's begin in the order then no Mecca over to you first and then we'll continue down thank you very much you for that question I don't think the code hub is going to remain in firm clusters and horticultural food production centers I think the shift is not fundamental we definitely go back to the markets you know you know our markets we definitely reopen we are critical because our markets are not only for business but they also cultural they have some traditional beliefs behind them our markets especially the food market serves as a melting pot or melting point for fresh produce you know it is actually cultural in a sense that our people gather to not only feel the freshness of food but to haggle on prices you know in spite of e-commerce in spite of the glory I mean the expansion of supermarkets all across Nigeria I think our markets remain the key plates to have access to fresh produce and also haggle and get the best price so code rubs will remain we will continuous up will firm clusters bocconcini have introduced aggregation centers and once the market reopens who will also reopen our code rooms in the markets yes okay should I take the next question no thanks for thanks for that question there's a lot of institutional changes going on at the moment and they are driven by by our desire to this more sustainable food system I think one of the things that we've realized if we really want to come to a net zero emission we will not only have to look at the way how our factory produces and how we transport but it means that we will also need to you know work together with farmers to make sure that we are growing the crops that are you know needed to do so yeah and in a way that they are indeed also contributing in a positive way so you know that's why we have also installed this regenerative agricultural code that we are now working on with our suppliers and inviting new suppliers from boredom - indeed drive that change together and actually there are multiple of such initiatives whether it goes from you know the raw materials that we put into our footprints whether it's talking about you know the packaging that we're using and how are we going to make sure that not only all our packaging is recyclable but that we also ourselves stimulate the demand for recycling by including recycled material into our packaging yeah and that is talking with suppliers but then also again with governments to make sure that they allow that because funnily enough we still have government governments that disallow using recycled material in packaging yeah for all the right reasons but there are solutions for that and we need to work together as one collective to tackle these initiatives yeah we're quite open on them so if you go to our website you can see our commitments and what kind of help you still need it and I invite everybody to join in on that to solve that collectively Stephen over to you yes so just just just to follow up on on on that question as I mentioned in my opening remarks I think that we are really right now in that refocus and reposition stage so I think the company is the forward-thinking companies the ones that are going to be resilient and right this crisis have already started that refocused and repositioned stage which is looking at business integrity scenario planning repositioning the way they do their business in this so-called new normal and I think there needs to be a recognition going to a comment set for me bye bye Tom there needs to be a recognition of supporting small holders and in ensuring that small holders and SMEs remain resilient specially those who are supplying to the large companies but I just had a very quick glance and I was very interested in Tom's presentation as well where he mentioned that a lot of SMEs have been resilient which I'm sure they are but I was also interested I I came across this study by the Sun Business Network where they had looked at SMEs in in Africa and in Asia and I think it was interesting to note that something like 94% of the SMEs that they surveyed and the surveil I think over 350 SMEs I said that they were impacted by depend on me mainly due by a decrease sales so I think for about 60% of them it was do we decrease sales for a lot of them like some of the large companies so about I think it's 49 percent said they had challenges accessing inputs and I think one of the bigger challenges for a lot of these SMEs and for even consumers the challenge that these SMEs faced was financial how do they pay their staff so I think that you know we've if you look at government policies and when I was talking about the sort of policies that governments need to bring in on if you look at broader policy development they also needs to be financial support especially to small and medium enterprises but then also some kind of social support for consumers going forward so I'll stop with that thank you yes rajul should I go yes please thank you Tom go ahead thank you yo for your question I think that in terms of whether ecommerce and delivery and mobile payments will will really take off in or continue their southern clime that we've noted in Africa and in South Asia Asia for example in India I think we can look historically to this because in many situations there's been a shock for example a food safety crisis like the bird flu just 10 years ago that quickly changed a number of market structures in many countries that those two regions for example moving wet markets out of the center of city instituting a number of changes in production so I think that the scramble that we see taking place now to adopt these technologies and extend ecommerce etc will continue will be accelerated by this crisis secondly as in the changes that we've seen in the supermarket revolution in the same regions it'll roll out and waves I was just talking to my Nigerian colleagues so we deliver poultice yet today and she was talking about how the e-commerce has really in delivery has really been grasped by urban Nigerians but still hasn't gone into the smaller towns in the rural area so jamia which is operating across africa has had a four-fold increase this period relative to the same period last year due to this and I think that this will continue to accelerate and slowly move out into other areas also of course modern actors large-scale actors and medium scale small and medium enterprises will be the first to take up these but it'll it'll it'll diffuse out I think something that will be very generalized and will happen quickly is a continuation the use of eat platforms in wholesale markets and logistics hubs that has already really taken off in a place like Myanmar in a situation that just a year ago I thought would never see any kind of a platform in the bean in posts association and in the dry zone of Myanmar suddenly now they adopted it they're using it in poor areas of India using e platforms for truck services these have all left into action and I don't think they're going to be undone after the Cova crisis thank you module you're muted okay thank you for that can you hear me now super let me come back to the live questions and then I will come to rob boss in a few minutes for him to ask questions but let me direct the first question to yo yo this question comes in from Klaus and I believe it's referring to your remarks at the beginning Klaus mentions resilience is key what low and middle-income countries have proved to be the most resilient up to now and what were the main reasons so you over to you thank you the yes we can hear you well I think it's not so much country versus country I think it's much more the type of a value chain or supplied system versus another that has been more or less resilient okay so we've seen if you look globally that and I know Rob has done quite a bit of work on that as well like I mean there's been I always have to be careful to put this because there's been tremendous problems okay let let me make that clear and there's a lot of vulnerability at the same time if you look globally access to basic food come out a stable food come up have held up relatively well okay even in in fairly poor countries and certainly in rich countries I mean this I mean there was a rush on the supermarket's at the outbreak of the of the disease but after that the supply of food has been very well I would say has been there this has been very specific problems for example in the u.s. meat sector now we have the same thing in the German meat sector I mean clearly they are there okay but on average industries it's been pretty good if you also look at for example there's been large problems for think about the export of perishable food and vegetables from Africa to Europe for example for Latin America to to the US there's been a lot of problems initially and that was why was that because some of these vegetable fresh fruits and vegetables they came in the same cargo as when the passengers went with with the same planes right but so if there was no more planes because there was no more passengers so the and the transport of the fruit and vegetables was not working but that has been companies starting adjusting to dad basically renting planes specifically for cargo etc and so and these things they have had relatively well I think the big problems are clearly in places where a lot of people had to come together basically to do the exchange of the products or to do the transport of things and so there there has been there has been tremendous problems I really do not want to under arrest underestimate that our own survey is that if we for example now show in countries like Ethiopia for example that urban consumers are really consuming particularly the poorest less dairy products less fruit and vegetables particularly fresh fruit and etc so they are clearly there but the fact that these things are heterogeneous that saw them have held up well that I think is promising in a sense it basically provides us lessons okay how to deal with this and so my most interesting issues now how do we see all the innovations burner ship going on in the ones which have not held up well the vulnerables how can we make those more resilient as well thank you very much you let me come to the next question that I'll direct that in the Mecca no Mecca you talked about repositioning and pivoting cold hubs how was it possible for you to do so quickly what is the role of the banking and credit industry and the related question is what is happening to the labor force in that you are employing especially with the women how were they coping as you were repositioning over to you new Mecca without resin credit from the banks you know we sold 20% 27% sorry of the company to in fact or aventures and withou in race now initially 15 to unify food robes which mean was very successful and after it was successful invited a lot of international development partners opportunity to come and look at what we are doing and they came out so what we are doing they measure the impact is very visible and measurable and we raised a couple of brands to expand rapidly across Nigeria in our Spanish dome with added at two places we first of all go to a market and we asked the wholesalers and retailers where do you get your tomatoes from they tell us where they get their tomatoes from and we go there and build a coatroom because we understand that is a cold chain is an infrastructure that needs to begin from the funds you know so we build those code room strategically within firms and producer communication centers and these produce education centers are basically homes we are small holder farmers bring their produce and they load it into a truck and the truck takes it to the markets you know so in either we are viewed in a different cluster or the produce Education Center and connecting it all the way to the outdoor market because at the end of the day majority of the food goes to the outdoor market and there is where consumers come to buy actually so we hired women all this while and these women we are still we still have a little bit of money and for the women who are our hub operators in markets they were closed we are taking care of their salaries and believing that the relaxation when he came very soon relaxation of Kobe 19 lockdown started yesterday with the announcement by the government that they now allow interstate movements meaning that a truck can lift Cano filled up with 400 baskets of tomatoes and bring it all the way down to a mistake a journey of 16 to 18 hours hours by law enforcement on the road you know so that is excellent and that is wonderful so the women glue our in our code room issue service operators no dinner no floating food and collecting user money they are being paid their salaries and we strongly believe that they will be back to work we engage them every day and we actually organize a lot of strategy sessions during the lockdown you know improving their skills and also telling them about our data standard operating procedures within the company yeah mekka thank you so much I'm going to direct the next question to Tom Rearden Tom this is a question coming from Rick over Mars with S&V and he notes the great intervention importance of SMEs question is how important and resilient is cross-border regional trade with SMEs and their supply chains what is there to win or what is there to improve over to you Tom thank you I think that first I wanted to just signal that a lot of focus is on trade in this crisis but we should keep in mind that in Africa ninety-one percent of all food consumed is consumed from domestic value chains that don't cross borders in India the figures 97 percent okay so that share that doesn't mean that trade is not important because it's crucial for several kinds of products and in place like Africa only maybe 15 percent in all of the trade is over borders and there's specific problems in various places of crossing the borders for example maize going from Uganda into Kenya where it's bought and so in that kind of situation the keeping open the ports and the border points is absolutely crucial and there's been a mixed success sometimes a lack of success in keeping those points flowing and open I like to say that the the the infrastructure the highways the ports the border crossings are the bones of the food system and then the blood of the food system are the wholesalers the logistics people and so to keep them moving and flowing it's necessary to make sure that those points are functioning and very often it's an infrastructure issue or repair of infrastructure and sometimes it's a policy issue we're in panic some government might shut something down or hold it back so I think the cross-border is extremely important especially for key situations in Africa where cities are in deficit of products from another country and it has to be allowed to be fluent so I applaud Rick's point thank you very much tom I want to give a heads up to Rob Voss that I will come to him off to the next question for any questions he may wish to ask the panelists but let me take this next question and I will direct it to Stephen Stephen this question comes from dr. Hamid bod our assistant professor at the University of Agriculture Faisal Abad in Pakistan and his intervention is as follows small growers in Asia are an important component of the food system in Asia it is difficult for them to adopt digital technologies and e-commerce food industry often prefers large farmers and neglect small growers what is the food industry doing to include small farmers and e-commerce over to you Stephen thank you very much and I'm trying to answer this question because I have to be honest I am not very conversant in what forestry is doing in terms of supporting small holders with e-commerce but I think it's certainly critical and we've seen from what's taken place with Cobie 19 that we bring everybody on board with digitalization and also with e-commerce I think that the reality is that you know no one can be left behind in this current situation that we are facing small holders SMEs are a critical part of the food value chain and we've seen that we've seen the issue where some governments in Indonesia haven't realized for example the importance of small holders the fact that to get produce from the farm to the fork you actually need farmers to get out even the fields and if you have a curfew that prevents farmers and their families from getting out into the field well that has a knock-on impact on the whole food value chain so I think we've got an opportunity here I mean Corbett has you know it's a tremendous challenge and I'm stating the obvious when I say that but it also provides us with an opportunity to change the way we do business and perhaps for some of the large companies that we work with you know it's an opportunity to bring some of these small holders on board you know we've got the technology we've got the knowledge around e-commerce if you look at some of the e-commerce platforms that we have a leader like Alibaba la serda red much etc these are all organizations that can use their resources their knowledge base and best practice to support small holders as well I think that to do that however we need collaboration so we need for industry we need governments we need intergovernmental organizations we need organizations like if free to get on board because we need to collaborate Ortner and bring everybody on this journey Thank You Steven I wonder if Tom also wishes to comment given that he focused on e-commerce quite a bit also in his remarks Tom did you wish you'd come in for a moment yes just to pick up from Stephens point the e-commerce that's been brought to bear has been often in partnership with small enterprises in delivery and logistics and the e-commerce has either been small platforms of local companies that are that have risen up and started to gain traction for large companies like Lassonde that he mentioned that's now owned by Alibaba from the past couple years and I'll give an example from lazada although I could give one from small enterprise to where there was some in Malaysia a flower firm that was a supplier a farm and they had very good contacts with a lot of retailers before kovin and then when ko bid struck they lost those links to the retailers and so lazada came in and is a new business opportunity that win-win it set up links between that flower firm in the many retailers so it became a business-to-business not just a business to consumer activity so I think that's an example thank you Tom let me now come to rob boss Rob I'm sure you have questions too for the panelists so let me come over to you now well thanks Reggio to everybody is a really fascinating discussion and have many questions but let me focus on one issue that may have not come to the fore as much as it should let's see the mom's side and the consumer side so what we're seeing as one of the impacts of this crisis not just people lose their incomes and through debts may have less access to food but also they're changing their consumption patterns so particularly we see shift which cheaper foods typically less nutritious foods the basic staples the great basic grains and so on and away from meats and animal source foods but for the grills of fruits and vegetables so my question to maybe make a Robert and Steven is house how their businesses are anticipating to that change and whether that's this is just a temporary change were more lossing change who the maker for instance he mentioned that the markets closure in Nigeria was was a main factor behind this business and downsize but maybe also with the change in consort Imam that may be something that even with the opening of markets will still have reduced Imams for the fruits and vegetables that go through the cold house and likewise for for the more the industrial sites I guess that is also a concern so just because of thing comes and price change but also because of food safety issues well some people change their consumer behavior because of the thing with the awareness of covert 19 and the risk may be higher with people that are malnourished they'd be overweight to shift there at the mound to more nutritious food so we see sort of these paradoxical trends so how our business is anticipating those trends moving forward yeah well thanks let me let me keep both I think we're seeing indeed a number of trends some of them they will maybe ease up as easement also comes so if you're thinking about the out of home consumption people are now wanting to enjoy you know restaurant experience at home if you you look at more to develop kind of markets so concluding propositions etc but for instance this whole trend towards plant-based eating which was already starting before Cove it came and now you know almost helped by you know the crisis that you see in the food chain around meat the people are starting to get more interesting that we definitely see a further acceleration of that and if you're now thinking ahead we do also expect that there will be an even larger demand but more affordable and more healthy new propositions yeah no doubt that as a consequence of everything that we're seeing at the moment people will be even become more cash constraint yeah so what can we do to you know collectively find solutions that people can still enjoy an affordable meal the right kind of healthy meal and you know and have access to that so those are definitely trends that that we see and we already see that now with countries opening up and closing closing down again you see some of these trends you know moving up and down but some will definitely stay in the indicating further acceleration and then basis I definitely hope will be will be one of them yeah I hope that that answers a bit of theory your question thank you Robert can we go then to steven next yeah so so it's a really good question they're all exciting we've done some work here in Asia with artificial intelligence firm looking at consumer behavior and it's very interesting some of the things that consumers have been for when it comes to food so they've been looking for if you like if you look at different food categories they are looking for food that has a longer shelf life obviously make sense people want to stock up their pantries with raw materials to cook big etc frozen food interestingly has declined in many of the markets here in Asia there's there is a push for food products that consumers perceive as being immunity boosting so you know belief that if they take more vitamin supplements etc they boost the immunity against Kobe 19 and then also traditional ingredients like lemon ginger etc there's been sort of demand for that kind of stuff interestingly however there's also been a strong demand for snacking and comfort food I guess while consumers are at home there's a lot of anxiety etc there's been a lot more munching on cookies chips etc and then to to Robert's point as well we've definitely seen a shift to plant-based proteins so so those are I guess some of the key takeaways that we have seen here it is a in terms of consumer behavior in this crisis I think another thing that that's probably going on globally as well is that more consumers perhaps because they've been locked down I actually eating at home and cooking at home so there's a lot more demand for online grocery delivery but also then cooking more healthy and nutritious food at home rather than eating out in in restaurants etc now Singapore relaxed it's sort of locked down on the 29 on two weeks ago actually and while there's been quite a few people going out to restaurants so the open restaurants not last Friday the Friday before there's still not the kind of demand that you would have seen here in Singapore previously in terms of going out and eating so I guess those are some of the key takeaways that we have seen here in Asia thank you shall we hear from them a comment I was I went off you know window question chemic so I don't know if you mind repeating the question Rob do you wish to come back in yes to make a well the question to you basically was how you expect the demand for fruits and vegetables in the areas where you work as cold helps to to change moving for so what we've seen in terms of changing consumption behaviour in many parts of the world is particularly where it comes to for areas where because of losses of income people shift more towards the staple foods maize and basic grains and so on and away from what nutritious foods or perishable foods partly because of matter of income and partly because of concerns about your food safety and so on so how you're anticipating that for the cold harsh thank you very much I think there will be a significant increase in consumption of fruit and vegetable moving forward after Kovach because you know a lot of our people here have started the I think they've developed their own cook vegan vaccine by eating very good food very green food and they said that it given them immunity you know there is a lot of consumption of rooted pumpkins and other twins there's a lot of fruits bananas and so on being consumed on daily basis everyone has this belief that if you increase your immunity that the virus can not over when you you know and that is everywhere in Nigeria so post kovat I think that has actually stopped with a lot of people on post codeine it's going to definitely be an increase in consumption of fruit and vegetable you know for other food loves we provide infrastructure to extend shelf life of food and have high a key fruit and vegetable available for consumption by the local population our goal is to extend the shelf life of food from two days to modern 21 days so the quality will be there it will be fresh and it can be consumed by a local population so we'll continue delivering that service I mean you know there are disadvantages of kovat on our business side we are lower in revenue but we strongly believe that possible video be huge demand for code hogs you know for the past just a chip-in over the past one year we've been talking to catfish dealers in Nigeria to use our service you know and they say hey listen we just harvest our cod fish on himself today they give us like two calls every day asking for when are you guys coming to the code room for us we have a state fish there are no buyers we need somewhere to keep the coat the fish code you know so and there is a lot of demand strawberry farmers are also increased demand we have a lot of demand going on so possible weed I think we're gonna have a lot of work to do yeah Akina Mecca Tom did I see your hand going up what did you wish to respond to yuck come in please Tom I think that diets of consumers have been changing very rapidly for 20 to 30 years in the region's we're talking about and if you think of it as a long guitar string and then you think of a crisis is plucks that string in it it reverberates and it goes back to normal and I think that there's every pressure to go back and process food was already a major part of consumption in all of these regions it's not starting it's it's more than half of food consumption driven by women working outside the home and other convenience things that's going to continue and it's going to intensify a little bit maybe with these sorts of things and then the diversification if you look at it in urban areas of Africa only one-third of the consumption is in grains and normally and two-thirds is in non grains in Asia that three-quarters are at non breaks and 1/4 in grains this whole bounce back in soon as the logistics and the wholesale is moving again as the mecca was saying and he'll be on the front lines getting it back basically the consumption will resume it's not going to go back to just not eating that processed food will of course be there it might receive a little push and I think what will happen is also I've been a student with the supermarket revolution in these countries expanding extremely quickly would you found after the avian flu was that a lot of people rushed to the supermarket's to get chicken packaged chicken from CPE and from other producers in the supermarket because they trusted it more and after the crisis they still stayed shopping in supermarkets this happened in the u.s. also with various crises so there'll be a little bit of a shift in where you get things supermarkets will go forward faster ecommerce will go forward faster but it won't rock the fundamental boat of the diversification of the diets that was already in play um thank you so much I'm aware that we are close to the end of the time and there are a number of questions we could not take and I apologize for that but let me read aloud the names of those people and appreciate that they took the time to ask us questions these include Vamsi Tata from The Culinary Institute of America mahesh chandra from india mr. snow Gia from india and Nastasia Crespo from project innovate in Newark Stedman Solomon or in Aaron Kyra tikka Nataraja and so forth apologies that we could not come to your questions but I'd like to give all the speakers a chance to give us the key takeaway messages and then I will call on Rob wants to make closing remarks let me go in reverse order of our speakers and begin with Tom and then go next to Steven and then go next to a Robert no Mecca and end with us winnin and each of you if we just hand over to each other that we create so let me call on Tom to start us off with your final takeaway messages Tom supply chains in Africa and in South Asia into the rest of Asia are absolutely critical for food security before Kovan they were growing very quickly they were transforming quickly they're very dynamic small and medium enterprises that are at the heart of those supply chains and they've also been dynamic what we've seen after the shock is that as was mentioned they were not to the mat okay and then after they were not to the mat they put one arm up another arm up one leg up another leg up and they're getting up and so I think that the key lesson is for donors for governments for private sector associations to say look it it's cut it's rising back up again let's think in the nitty-gritty of what are the things that are missing that we can help to leverage help them get back up again not reinvent the wheel not push them aside and start the thing over ourselves but try to think what do they need to get lifted off that mat and help themselves to get up and as I said it's bones and blood the bones are the wholesale markets the highways the cross border ports and end points it's the physical infrastructure and the policies that surround at the blood are all these active agents the wholesalers the logistics the what I called the hidden middle the people that were ignored to a certain extent in the debates beforehand they are the ones that are going to hook the farmers up to the consumers they are the ones that will be champions of this there are large enterprises like we've heard here there are small enterprises like we've read about and heard in the case of the small fishers and I think that ecommerce and digitalization will be part of that solution going forward thank you thank you so just summarize Degrassi just to state the obvious we are currently facing an unprecedented crisis which is putting unexpected pressure certainly on food supply chains here across Asia resolving this and I believe that resolving some of the pressure that we see on the food supply chains is possible there are opportunities to do this but it will require uncommon collaboration between governments civil society academia and industry because at the end of the day we need to ensure that consumers across Asia and globally have access to safe healthy and nutritious food thank you yeah thanks look we were talking about it just bit earlier some changes will go and some changes will stay and if if I could you know if I had a wish that at least one good thing would come out of Kovac I would personally hope that it would help us to now really as one collective accelerate the work that we need to do to come to a more inclusive and a more sustainable food system and you know I'm convinced that we'll need to be a global food system in order it for it to be resilient like we were just talking about but also for it to be affordable for the eight billion people on this planet so I hope that is that is one change that Cove it will really help us to drive home fast thank you connect thank you very much robot I think really is Kovac has actually exposed the inefficient food supply chain that exists in the world you know and it has also brought to the forefront that they it's very difficult for us to achieve food security because of this inefficient food supply chain and I think that postcode vide after all this lockdown has been lifted everywhere in the world and we return back to normal I think the global food player should look deeply at the food supply chain it is so broken and they try as much as possible to fix it I think that walk has to be done both by private sector by public sector by civil society and every other person who is super interested in food there is a role that digital and e-commerce and infrastructure please and I think bringing every party together will enable other achieve an efficient food supply chain there is no hunger in the world it's actually a problem of supply chain okay thank you very much I thought this was a wonderful panel the point I want to make is that there is I mean it's always interesting when you talk to people from the private segment today was not different that they focus is just as much on the opportunities then on the challenges there and I think that's really an important lesson for all of us who are studying what is going on okay to see the opportunities and in the current crisis we related to that I really enjoy it a point on Nigeria how so far most of the stories I heard about consumers believes how particular foods they should not eat because there would be infected by corporate so here is a little bit the other way around that actually the Cova gives an incentive to eat more healthy than before that's very interesting I also learned from Robert that Heineken was not an essential product in in Brazil during the kovat I wonder whether that applies to beer in general because the Brazilians are major stakeholders in Budweiser and Stella so I don't know yeah and the last thing I learned was that Tom can give a full talk and wrapping up comments okay with that review back to you thank you very much thank you to all of the speakers I would like to now turn to rob force to give closing remarks Rob over to you thanks Virgil and thanks to everybody this day to the fascinating discussion if anything that has come from this health crisis is to make clear the centrality of the food systems without food no health and Ric what's also the panels made clear this big paradox that we're seeing was you know one hands food supply changed they're very resilient that have been able to hold up amidst these big shocks on supply sites and also big demand shocks and continue providing foods in general well but we also see these big vulnerabilities to covert 19 directly and indirectly because of the perimeter measures as led to severe disruptions and in which quite a bit of heterogeneity and the impacts are being felt across the system so we did that what I learnt from this panel particularly is number one dance well what we know of course is that since the food system is mainly driven by market players is that's a into individual players and collectively have shown quite a bit of that supra nurse yet and innovation in order to prevents this overall health crisis to become a major food crisis around the world we're not there yet is the risks are still there but particularly in the shifts that in terms of entrepreneurship tomato the meat was talking about and quickly shifting his business in two different locations to that to changing circumstances Unilever providing credits to their suppliers and they make sure that their supply chains that people write but they're more particularly also the adjustments made through e-commerce and those that's by big plays but most importantly what some bread and emphasized by also by a lot of small and medium scale enterprises that despite a big hits they've taken and they found ways to rule themselves up there doesn't mean we're there yet of course with golf 19 we can expect a lot of the ongoing dynamics to continue maybe with renewed impulses also that have come from covert nineteen the fruit is innovation and the preneur should either private sector but we also know that's without good government support to facilitates the business in keeping the green lanes open for trade flows and that workers but also to facilitate food safety as well as do the things that need to be done to protect access to foods to many consumers but also and that will close with that is the challenges that we had before go with nineteen are not going away so we'll still have to challenge the threat climate change affecting our food systems the health threats that's burnt food system photos in many ways and we've seen some good examples that maybe machines on shifts in the right direction but probably not all is well once the with the pandemic under control so with that we can only hope that with the entrepreneurship and innovation that we're seeing along food value chains that that rule should be the basis to leverage towards more inclusive healthy and more sustainable food systems and hopefully we can have more events like this to monitor well how the private sector is changing in in all its forms in all the shapes in order to get to those more inclusive healthy and sustainable food systems thank you thank you very much Rob thank you to all of our speakers
