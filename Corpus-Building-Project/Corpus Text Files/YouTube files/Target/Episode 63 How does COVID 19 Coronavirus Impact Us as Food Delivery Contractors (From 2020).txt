you know how the song goes sweet home alabama where the skies are blue sweet home alabama lord i'm coming home to you that's 20 seconds once you kind of make room for the little instrumentals in between those phrases there's your hand washing song you can thank me later for not singing it for you hello courier nation welcome to the deliver on your business podcast where you are the boss each week we talk about how to make the most of your business as an independent contractor as a courier delivering for gig economy apps like grubhub doordash postmates ubereats and so many others [Music] well hey there courier nation welcome back for another week and what a week it's been huh this has been crazy i think all the stuff that's happened just really in the last couple of days with all these cancellations and different things happening with what's happened with the stock market all this stuff around ronavirus and let me ask you how is it impacting you have have you personally been impacted in in what kinds of ways i'd love to hear from you as far as what it's doing to you and that leaves us with a lot of questions you know what do we do with this should we even be delivering is it safe to deliver what's going to happen there's so much stuff and i don't have any answers maybe that's why i haven't really talked about it much i've not really dug into this a whole lot because well you know other than i think i had one article i'll put a link in the show notes about grubhub's attendance policy and why that could be maybe one of the worst things when it comes to keeping everybody safe but other than that i've not really touched on it i haven't done it with the podcast or anything and even though it's been such a big deal and it's not that i'm not taking this thing seriously because it is extremely serious i think there's a part of it was you know not wanting to jump on a bang bandwagon not wanting to get up there and talk about it because everybody else is maybe not wanting to turn people off by trying to you know looking like i'm capitalizing on it by you know doing click bait and drawing people in because that's what they're thinking about part of it i think is just understanding that i'm not an expert and so why would i think anybody would wanna you know there's so many people that have so much better to say about this than i do so why even bother with it let the experts take care of it but the thing is is i don't want to ignore it i know that there's a lot of people that come to the blog lately i've got a number of you that listen to this podcast uh try to figure out why but you know the thing is is people do come and part of it is because i did create this website and and i do believe that i'm doing that i'm helping people by creating this because i'm trying to help people get a grasp on owning your own business in this food delivery independent contractor space and so you know what this this whole thing with the coronavirus is part of it because it's impacting our businesses isn't it so let's talk about it now i'm not going to try and approach this with all the advice and all the tips and tricks because i'm not an expert hell i'm trying to figure out a lot of this myself you know i'm trying to understand what's what where's where but you know what my opinions will probably show up in a couple places here on this so make sure you understand this now even when i'm throwing out opinions i'm not an expert i don't know public health i don't know medicine i don't know immunology i don't know any of that stuff i barely have a clue about it i've read some stuff but i don't know enough to know whether any of that stuff i read is really useful or or correct or any of that stuff you know what i mean and so i've got no basis to call myself an expert and so if you see some opinions coming up just remember that what i just told you i'm not an expert okay but maybe i can offer maybe some thoughts and maybe sometimes just talking about it is helpful you know because people are scared right now and the fear it's not just about the virus but the the economy it's about you know you watch the stock market tank all those different things so it's got everybody a little bit nervous and a lot of people wondering and so i don't know you know maybe maybe it's a good time just to kind of spew a few of my thoughts or something and i don't know if this will be shorter or not there's a lot to talk about but again we get back to that thing about i'm not an expert and that part alone should be enough to make this kind of short you know let me start with where i am about this i'm not afraid of the coronavirus okay it doesn't mean that i don't think that i could catch it it doesn't mean that i don't think if i caught it that it could kill me or couldn't kill me or whatever i'm not that arrogant i am not immortal i'm not any different than anybody else uh this thing could really pack a wallop and and there is a possibility that i come down with it and and the fact that i'm in contact with so many people doing delivery maybe even a higher possibility i don't know but i'm not afraid of it because the bottom line is this thing cannot defeat me there's nothing that can defeat me unless i let it yeah it it could even kill me you know but killing me doesn't defeat me i'm i'm not sure how to explain that without turning this into a discussion about faith and things like that that's not what this blog or this podcast are about glad to talk with anybody about that if they want to individually or whatever but i'm just going to leave it as i think there's some things that are just much greater than even my own life and whatever this could do to me or something like that but the bottom line is because of the things that are most important to me this thing can't defeat me so it doesn't mean that you don't take it seriously though you know let me put it this way i'm not afraid of traffic you know i drive in traffic all the time i deliver downtown where there's a lot of traffic i'm walking in traffic i'm pulling in and out of traffic all this stuff i ride my bike sometimes i do my bike for deliveries and i do it downtown and you're dealing a lot with traffic and and man that's one of those places where if you're going to be afraid of traffic that'd be the place to be afraid right but i'm not afraid of it but i do respect it you know i look around before i step out in the street i pay attention to what's going on around me i don't just cut out in traffic you know i use my turn signals all sorts of different things like that you know that's being smart about it it's not being afraid it's being smart and i think that's the difference here we don't have to live in fear but we can be smart and uh guys that this is uh you know now now they're calling it a pandemic that's something that's not done lightly i know a lot of people kind of have their conspiracy theories about what that means or whatever that them trying to kind of take control whatever i'll let them kind of have that i i honestly it's you know what if it gets to that point there's something serious going on okay but we don't have to live in fear of it we can just be smart about it now here's the thing guys this is not the freaking flu okay there's been a tendency to compare it to the flu i think i probably thought that for a while too you know because how many more people have caught the flu this year how many more people die of it and i think when the dust settles on this whole thing when it all kind of gets back to normal it's still going to be the case that is nowhere close to what happens with the flu so why are we so caught up with this stupid virus right i don't know honestly i don't know this is this is one of those i'm not an expert things so i won't try and pretend that i am but i think it comes down more to potential i think it comes down more to this the what can happen because here's the deal you know what i think if somebody were to sneeze somebody that's got the coronavirus were to sneeze in the middle of a room of 20 people and in another room of 20 people all very similar same kind of makeup of people things like that and somebody with the flu sneezes in there you've got a higher chance of the people in that first room catching the disease you've got a higher chance of somebody dying from the disease you've got just a lot more risk with that and i don't know that it's necessarily that the coronavirus itself is any stronger than the flu or anything like that it's not about that as much as we're not equipped for it you know our immune systems aren't equipped for it our medical system isn't even equipped for it right now now that's not a knock on the medical system it's it's a fact the matter that we haven't had time to be equipped for it this is new and that's why the immunity system isn't there you know we're around the flu all the time we we are probably in contact with people and with the flu far more often than we realize but part of it is they call it herd immunity you know that just because because you've been around it it's kind of like your body's had a chance to kind of be equipped to deal with it and if you do catch it your body's a little better equipped to deal with it and the hospitals are more equipped with the things that they can do to help you through that but with coronavirus that's that's this is a whole new thing this is something that they've not experienced before and they're still trying to get their get a grasp on on what can we do to help in those situations we haven't had a chance to develop vaccines we haven't had a chance to totally figure those things out and our body has no idea how to deal with this thing because it is so new and that's why it um it can just you know ravage communities maybe even nations you see what's happened with uh china but even italy what's going on in italy right now and so it's not so much like i said i don't know details i don't know that information i think the bigger thing though is that the concern has more to do with the potential but the question is that we've got to ask ourselves is how does this impact our delivery work now there's a lot of belief that we may see a lot more deliveries happen and that's a real possibility you've got people staying home you've got people that have to go home now to stay with their kids because their kids have to stay home because school's out and you've got all sorts of things like that that there may be a lot higher demand for deliveries i think you know demand for delivery in china really spiked and we could see the same thing happen here i think we could see some negatives you know first of all are people comfortable with delivery and let's let's put it this way um when i started doing delivery a couple years ago nobody was sealing the bags you know now there are so many places that they have special bags that you pull the tape off and it seals it from the inside or else they put tape over the edges or different things like that because they're afraid of drivers reaching in and eating the food and if people are concerned about drivers eating the food that means they're concerned about drivers touching their food and if they're worried about a virus you think they're going to be comfortable with delivery you know here's here's the other side of things is i think the economic impact could really eliminate a lot of disposable income so there are things that could actually reduce deliveries i don't know what's going to happen but you know the other side of it is what happens if deliveries do skyrocket is that going to be a good thing or could it be a bad thing in the end because these delivery companies are losing money as badly as they are if things just really get out of control as far as a lot of people are ordering deliveries that means that they got to start paying a lot of money to get their drivers out there because every time that there's a high demand you got to go with higher peak pay or bonuses or different things like that or if you're grub hub you promise more bonuses that you don't intend to pay on but anyway the thing is is they're paying more money out they're already losing money now they got to pay more money to get these deliveries you know so it could actually if they're losing money now more deliveries could mean losing more money and the other side of it is these guys are all so freaking inefficient and and the whole system is really inefficient i've talked about this a number of times in the past but if they can't fix those inefficiencies and if they can't do it quickly it could be in the long term a death blow because yeah they get more business for the short term but they get a lot more bad experiences and they may never recover from that so those are some of the things you know you got to think about is it yeah it could mean more deliveries it could mean maybe more profitability short term it could hurt in the long run i don't know i'm not nostradamus you know now what do we do though and guys i'm not going to try and repeat all the different advices out there of course i'm sure i'll still end up repeating but there's a lot of good stuff out there you know stride health has a real good resource guide for independent contractors i'll put a link in the uh in the description here in in the show notes and that can be a good starting place uh most of the companies have sent out some stuff that sometimes it has some helpful stuff there so but here are a couple things that i really recommend and the first one is live live your life don't live in fear like i said it's kind of like i said with traffic you know you'd be smart but but don't let this thing control you don't let it end your life and and for god's sakes don't spend your life savings on toilet paper i don't know what the deal is with toilet paper you know are i don't know are they are they using it so they can kind of create these homemade masks or something maybe they're duct taping this stuff to their face but i don't see a run on tape so maybe that's not the case i don't know what it is but don't do panic stuff don't do stupid stuff and don't live in fear maybe this is an opportunity and take it as an opportunity you can connect with family a little more you know if you got to kind of get cooped up with somebody deep in your relationship take the opportunity sometimes to focus on the things that bring you joy that bring you meaning just keep living that's the most important thing i want to really encourage you to think about paid time off now this is a big issue right now with the gig economy a lot there's a lot of discussion out there that are people kind of beating the drum that you know what uh these delivery companies should be giving you some paid time off and some of them are promising to do that with a lot of strings attached you know and that way it kind of if you don't deliver if you don't feel safe going out and delivering you know then you don't take the financial hit right makes sense when your employees but and and maybe i don't know you know that that gets you back to this whole employee versus independent contractor thing and uh i think though in fact as i bring this up there's a couple of issues that i just want to get off my chest okay the first one is grub up i wrote this article earlier i'll put a link in the description on this article their attendance policy is one of the worst things for what's going on right now you know a lot of companies are responding they're responding positively they're offering paid time off if you get sick different things like that grubhub so far seems to be doing nothing and they've got this attendance policy that makes it worse because if you let's say because with grubhub you have to schedule blocks you know and you've got to schedule blocks to get meaningful delivery offers in most markets so okay you schedule a block you're not feeling well they even advise you in one of their emails say if you're not feeling well stay home but their policy says something different if you drop your blocks you may not be able to schedule blocks later on so what's the deal with that grubhub you gotta change that okay doordash i'm kind of unhappy with how they said stuff too because yeah they sent out a thing oh hey guys we're gonna give you paid time off and then if you read the end oh by the way we're gonna fire you when that happens and but you can file an appeal to get back and you know i don't know i'm sure they didn't intend it to look like being fired but said you're going to be deactivated as soon as uh you're placed on this paid time off and then you can file an appeal to get back on and everything like that but there's no guarantee that they're going to put you back on and so maybe it was just stupid maybe it was something they put together in a hurry but it was just really really poorly done you know so some of these things it's like these companies are still not totally getting it you know but here's the deal folks we're not employees okay do not expect things from employers when you don't have an employer because you are your employer you might not agree with them doing that and and i'm i understand there are issues there but the fact of the matter is you signed up that way that is what you agreed to and if you did not pay attention when you signed the contract that's your fault not theirs okay so let's just get that out there and and that's why i have a little bit of a problem with some of the uh posturing that a lot of people are doing with this because we agreed when we did this that we're independent contractors were business owners now here's the deal with this whole thing right now like i said you know the economic impact is starting to really hit um i'm from lincoln nebraska but omaha is just an hour away from there and omaha is getting a double whammy with this so a whole sports cancellation thing omaha was going to be hosting uh some of the ncaa basketball tournament and every year omaha big big big deal in omaha a big financial thing in omaha too is the college world series well that's been canceled even though it's in june but it's just one of those precautions trying to i think part of it was trying to kind of discourage colleges from even continuing the college baseball season but the bottom line is you've got these major events that everybody was planning on that are not going to happen now and there are i'm sure some restaurants there are some places that are going to go under because they're not going to get this money that they're depending on nobody's talking about giving them paid time off you know that's part of the thing about running a business that's part of the risk you take and and you know that's part of what i'm trying to do is get help people understand that this is what you're doing and if you're not comfortable with that risk then do something else you know so but anyway the thing is what i'm really trying to get you to do is take responsibility and you take control don't rely on these companies are going to do it because these companies are scum i'm sorry you know all other things you know everything that i just said the problem is they're still scum and they're not going to come to your rescue you know and so understand that now but you take responsibility here's the deal folks is i've got paid time off if i need it because my employer is giving it to me i am that employer that's the whole thing about being self-employed and part of that if you're going to have an employee even if that employee is you you take responsibility for your employee right this is an important thing that i preach a lot of times and if you go to episode 30 in the podcast i get into this in more detail but one of the things that you can do then is give yourself a paycheck and and and the whole idea here is instead of treating that money that comes in from grubhub and doordash and ubereats and all those as your pay that's your income for your business but that's not your personal income your personal income is the paycheck that you give yourself after everything else is left over and part of that is to give yourself paid time off now here's what i do is i put fifty dollars a week into the bank and this is not vacation savings this is not like just saving up for something else this is my paid time off fund and if i get into a situation where i can't earn money if i get sick or if i decide i'm going on vacation then that money that i need on a regular basis i take that out of the paid time off fund because it's not coming in from my work if some week you know what i need six hundred dollars a week or so and some week i only earn two hundred dollars and then i'm home sick well i can pull that four hundred dollars left oh the extra four hundred dollars out of the paid time off fund that's how that works now i've had people argue that's not really the same as paid time off well it is because if you go to any other business you've got to accrue that paid time off there are some very rare exceptions but in most cases it's either you know you work so many hours and after so many hours you get an hour of pto or you work so many months and then you get your so many days of vacation time any of those different things the only difference is that you're the one making it happen rather than your boss except that's not a difference is it because who's your boss who is your employer your employer is giving you paid time off so it's not that different i really recommend start that practice if you haven't done it already because it's not just about coronavirus but it's about what you should be doing anyway to take care of your employee and especially if you rely very much on this income start doing this start setting some of that money aside instead of spending it as a way of giving yourself some paid time off when you need to take that time off later on now if you're a little concerned about the current situation and you haven't done anything maybe this is the time that you do as dave ramsey says you just start stockpiling money you know find a way you cut your costs work more if you have to do whatever you need or something like that so that you can build up a fund to take care of yourself if you're not able to go out and work so think about giving yourself paid time off the other thing i really recommend is just be smart here's the question that i don't know the answer to but you got to think about this question anyway and is and that is should you keep delivering all the rest of the world is self-isolating you know sporting events in schools or shutting down businesses or having everybody stay at home and work from home and all of a sudden now you're going to be one of those people who is probably in more contact with other people than anybody else out there that you know you know because you're you're going into the restaurants and you're taking food to the people be smart about that contact that you have with people i can't tell you whether or not it makes sense or not to deliver i will tell you that i will probably keep delivering um as long as i feel like i'm healthy and everything like that but part of that decision is that i've been blessed with i think a pretty good level of immunity now my mom says i ate a lot of dirt as a kid and probably a lot of other stuff too that i shouldn't have been eating and maybe that's why you know if i could survive that i could probably survive about anything i don't know but you know that's me i don't catch that much uh i don't get sick very often and usually when i do i recover pretty well and so for me i don't know maybe i feel like there's a little bit less risk but if you you know yourself and and and that helps you determine how cautious you need to be and but the main thing is just be smart about your interactions be smart about what you're doing and one of the smartest things that you can do is be clean because here's the deal you generally not gonna catch it just breathing okay it's just not gonna it's it's very rarely gonna happen that way um it's one of those deals that okay somebody sneezes it's kind of in the air for a little while gravity plays you know takes its toll but you know if somebody sneezes on you directly they're not a hell of a lot you can do there you know and but that's and that's why there's so much self-isolation going on and everything like that but outside of that most of the risk of spreading comes through contact and usually that's contact that you've got with yourself and here's the deal the viruses can't get through your skin you're generally not going to just breathe it in most of the time when you catch something like this it's because the virus got in through a few areas of entry into your body you know and a couple of those areas of entry are covered up most of the time or they should be or else you might be going to jail you know what i'm saying but you know it's your eyes it's your mouth it's your nose and and it's more like the membranes around your nose and things like that that's where the virus is entering and that's why they tell you not to touch your face i know and i gotta tell you when when when you started becoming more conscious about that i started realizing how often i am touching my face and i seriously kind of wonder if it doesn't make sense to get one of those protective collars that dogs wear because it can't you know if if i'm still want to touch my face i can get around that okay and it's a little different than with a dog but it certainly kind of reminds you not to do that you know and so that's but that's the thing and and that's why they tell you to wash your hands a lot because we're not real good at touching our face but if we keep our hands as clean as possible there's less chance of there being something on our hands when we do touch our face so be clean i think another reason to be clean has more to do with just comfort factor for everybody else there's reassurance i'm going to tell you something i am so much more conscious about just the appearance of being clean um i'm a guy that i'm a little lazy about shaving it's like every three days or so i'm doing it daily now i'm as clean-shaven as i can be and i am making sure that everything i'm wearing is crisp and clean appearing and everything like that for delivery maybe it's overboard um you know here a while back i think i talked about doing delivery versus ride chair and one of the reasons that i don't feel like going into rideshare is i don't want to go to that level of keeping my car as immaculate as you have to to be able to be really do really well at rideshare but lately i've been doing that you know i've been keeping that car so much more closer to spotless as i can and it all has to do with appearances because you know it's like i said there are some people i don't want touching my food on delivery i don't want to be that guy you know i don't want to be that delivery person that as i drop it off people are like oh man what did i just get into you know and so if i can look as clean as possible and be as clean as possible i think it's better for them and probably better for me maybe it's even better for tips too and i've been doing a lot more uber eats lately but be clean stay home when it's time to stay home and you know if you're feeling sketchy maybe you're wondering if you're coming down with something don't take chances just stay home both for yourself for those who will be in contact with you it's just better that way and more than anything like i said earlier don't forget to live folks i know this is a scary time and people are going bonkers out there i mean like i said toilet paper all you got to do is say toilet paper and you know what i'm talking about but we don't know what this is going to turn into we don't know what's going to happen we don't know what this will do to our industry what our futures any of that stuff but we don't know that it's going to be as bad either but the main thing is we're going to be okay don't let fear control you live your life focus on things that matter dwell on things that give you strength and comfort choose to be okay with this choose to believe that it's going to be okay because it will and because the important thing is you can be the one to take control here because even with the coronavirus out there you can still be the boss [Music]
