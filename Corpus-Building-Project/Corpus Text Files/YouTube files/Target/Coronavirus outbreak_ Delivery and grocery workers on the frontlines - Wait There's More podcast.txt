[Music] if you're doing social distancing properly and I really hope you are chances are that one of the only reasons you've left your house is to do groceries and if you're like me you're probably also relying more than ever on places like Amazon to deliver stuff to your door and the pressure on the people who work at these places has never been higher while a lot of us are being encouraged to stay at home to slow the spread of Kovan 19:00 the people working in our grocery stores delivering packages and cleaning our buildings are being seen as essential and because of that they've accidentally found themselves on the frontlines of this pandemic today I'm talking to my friend Sarah much two heads a day she covers labor issues for the Toronto Star and she's been talking to a lot of these workers about what they're going through and how the companies they work for are dealing with this new normal I'm Tamera Ken Decker and you're listening to wait there is more [Music] hey Sarah thanks so much for doing this hey no problem so I live in a condo and all the packages get delivered to the security desk and it's a big building so there's always a mountain of packages from Amazon and since the start of the pandemic this pile has looked bigger than ever so people are obviously staying home and ordering more stuff and I know you've been reporting on this and talking to people who work for companies like Amazon so to start off can you just describe to me what did this change look like for them at work yeah so I started hearing probably two weeks or so ago now from workers in Amazon's fulfillment centers and the GTA and what they were really telling me was they were seeing this mounting kind of order volume coming in they were seeing more workers being hired to deal with the colonel orders they were telling me it basically looked like peak season which is Christmas time when it's super crazy in there things started to escalate as the kind of seriousness of kovat really started to sink in and we're getting more and more like direction from government to stay at home and so from their perspective what that was doing was just really increasing the pressure of processing those orders what did that pressure look like did it mean like working more hours longer shifts what did that look like yeah so basically their managers were offering overtime to basically anyone who's willing to take it so they're working upwards well more than 50 hours a week to keep up with the volume of orders again hiring more temporary positions unlike from their perspective the concerns around that were that they're working in facilities where there are sometimes 2,000 people who work there on a regular basis and the production lines are busy they're crowded the lunch rooms are crowded their departmental meetings in the morning have hundreds of people sometimes on like a regular day and so from their perspective they were scared because the government is saying stays six feet away from people and meanwhile their production lines are busier than ever and the facilities that are bigger than ever right and social distancing becomes even more difficult as the workplace gets more and more crowded to meet this increased demand yeah I mean I think Amazon has now you know after we started reporting on this and not just in Canada by all accounts facilities across North America and in Europe but there were some measures taken to kind of ease the load so they've now I guess spaced out the working stations so they're only staffed every other working stations they can maintain a bigger distance between them but at the same time the people who are like processing the orders are still working in pairs so social distancing this kind of environment is really really difficult to do it completely from what workers were telling me it's not it's just not really possible given the setup of picking up orders and packaging them you are working in pairs you're criss crossing with other people it's very difficult to fully do that and also like get the work done okay and what other changes have they made to protect workers and deal with these new pressures that are being placed on them so yeah the big concerns that I've been hearing were around crowding in the warehouses the bottlenecks when people are arriving at work you know it was really crowded they were telling me to get into the warehouse to start their shift the lunch rooms were crowded departmental meetings were still happening oh and another big concern was face masks people wanted face masks and they were also really concerned that seasonal staff in particular don't have access to paid sick days though you know there are questions around our people coming in with symptoms or feeling ill and what are the risks with that so um what Amazon has done in kind of in response to all of that is first of all prioritized essential orders they are sort of trying to limit the non-essential orders that are being put through although what I'm hearing is on the ground so far not much has changed in terms of what the workers are seeing but what the workers are seeing change is kind of greater social distancing measures so they've allowed people to stagger their start times either by like starting 15 minutes earlier or later so that those bottlenecks actually getting into the facility aren't happening they've told people that they can only set one person per like lunchroom table to try and implement some social distancing there they've can't fold the departmental meetings and they've spaced out the workstations so every other work station isn't manned anymore so there's more space between them they're also increasing pay for this kind of temporary period where you know things are kind of crazy we'll continue to do everything we can to keep you healthy safe and protected the work you are doing means everything right now thank you added pay is obviously being well-received by workers you know they're pleased at the social distancing measures but I think what remains are these problems which are systemic problems really and are being exposed by Kovan but we're pre-existing you know it is the access to paid sick days and should you have to choose between losing a day's income and coming in to work when you're potentially sick and can potentially infect other people we've got people that are still coming to work sick because they can't afford to stay home she said care April asked us to protect her identity because her daughter an employee at the same facility got tested for coronavirus before work today but she has bills stacking up while she's waiting on those results so just to be clear if an Amazon worker feels sick how much time can they take off so what amazon has said is that they're encouraging people to use a mix of unpaid and paid leaves if they're feeling sick so basically what it boils down to is what are you entitled to as an Amazon warehouse worker if you're a permanent employee you do have access to for paid sick days but those are accrued over time and you don't get the full four until May so some people have already used them of their accrued paid sick days which means they don't have any left in which case they would have to take an unpaid emergency leave day if they're feeling ill if you are a temporary worker you don't have any paid sick days so a combination of like what the Ford government has said around being able to take time off if you're sick and not lose your job is one layer of protection for those workers and I think Amazon is sort of offering the same guarantee but it doesn't mean you're going to get paid yeah so basically if I'm feeling sick I have to kind of decide if I don't have any paid sick am I gonna go in and risk getting everyone else sick and getting worse or am I gonna stay home and lose that money that I would have earned yeah I mean that's the decision that's potentially facing a large number of workers in these facilities Amazon has said that if you are diagnosed with kovat you will get 2-page weeks off so that element is paid but I think it's the leader that people are really worried about and also you know if you have been in contact with someone who has traveled or you think you may have potentially been exposed that you haven't been diagnosed you know what workers were telling me is there's a lot of questions around that as well like should I not come in can I be compensated for that there's still a lot of outstanding concerns around this kind of gray area before an actual diagnosis so when the US workers are walking off the job because they want access to more paid sick leave right now that's only available to people who've tested positive for the coronavirus or people who get placed on mandatory self quarantine and they're also asking for their warehouses to be closed for longer periods of time and more cleaning and guaranteed pay is there a push for something like that here right now there's a petition circulating right now that was spearheaded by the warehouse workers Center in Brampton which is a new organization that's you know really set up because we're housing in particular is quite a precarious job it's pretty low wage its very low unionization rates and so they are sort of taking this on on behalf of Amazon workers one thing I heard speaking to a number of workers was a real kind of fear of raising these issues with management and a feeling of fear around advocating for oneself in the workplace yeah so yeah right now there's a petition circulating it's gotten hundreds of signatures you know I think that the response from Amazon so far has definitely helped and you know that people are sort of heartening to see that but I definitely think that the paid sick is something that is really like crystallizing as a major issue that I think will continue to be of concern after kovat fears settle down a little bit we're not seeing you know the strikes and and more sort of decisive action from workers at this point but I think it's definitely top of people's minds it was reported that workers at 13 Amazon warehouses have tested positive for covin 19 but Laura Williamson isn't afraid to speak up because she works there too and her life might depend on it I have lupus I have a compromised immune system she says the company has taken precautions staggering shifts and breaks spacing out benches and microwaves doling out hand sanitizer and social distancing guidelines but she says they can afford to do much more how has the company handled those situations like do they close the warehouses down or how do they move forward when someone tests positive at one of these facilities the first case first positive diagnosis in the US was in New York area warehouse and my understanding was that they closed down and reopened the next day and so there were concerns over whether that is the appropriate amount of time to deal with something like that Moreno Valley Amazon says they're going to great lengths to keep the building clean the employee diagnosed with Kovac 19 is now quarantined at home and they've asked everyone who was in close contact with that person to self quarantine - but Laura says employees are still touching all the same shipping materials so they're all in close contact and I actually think this is a much bigger issue there's a lot of confusion around what is the evidence-based protocol when you have a positive diagnosis like when you look at other companies like Toyota Toyota Cambridge had a positive kovat diagnosis about a week ago and they've shut down for weeks employers are responding very differently and really what needs to happen is sort of evidence-based government guidelines around what you should you if you're a big employer that's had something like this happen in their workplace because right now it seems like it's dressed up to like the individual employers discretion you know I spoke to the federal Labor Minister last week and I know that the federal government is working with the provincial labor ministries to kind of provide expert advice on best practices and certain sectors right now they're looking at trucking and food processing to kind of come up with guidelines on how to keep those workplaces safe during kovat so I think that there's starting to be some movement on that but they haven't addressed the warehousing sector yet which really is a huge one like it's so critical for you know supply chains and everything it will be right back [Music] I also wanted to talk to you a little bit about cleaners who have also found themselves sort of on the front lines of this pandemic and you've been talking to cleaners in Toronto - tell me a little bit about the conversations you've been having and how their work conditions have changed since all these workplaces started cracking down on unco bid yeah so with cleaners I mean cleaners long before kovat were probably one of the most precarious jobs in Canada a lot of cleaners are being misclassified as independent contractors so they are not entitled to like any protections under employment laws you know getting paid minimum wage if not less exposed to a lot of dangerous chemicals than not give an appropriate training not given safety equipment a lot of undocumented workers who really fear it speaking up for their rights and then you throw in kovat and what we're seeing is a real polarization of workers who are in some cases losing their jobs because the office building everyone is now working from home so there's no need for cleaners in the building for cleaners particularly who are undocumented and cannot access the new government funds that have been made available it is a really terrifying time like I spoke to one worker who just doesn't know how she's gonna eat like there's really no support network for these workers and then on the other end of the spectrum you have cleaners who their work has just gone into overdrive they're cleaning these enormous grocery stores making sure that they're safe for the rest of us to use and meanwhile they're being paid less than minimum wage they're being introduced to new chemicals that they don't know what they are they're being asked to work overtime and not being paid for it one woman who I spoke to who is cleaning large downtown grocery stores said she doesn't have a face mask she has to wash her plastic gloves at the end of each shift because she only gets one pair a week and what they told me was they're just exhausted and scared by the environment that they find themselves in now and and you know feel like very little attention has been paid to like a job that is so critical right now do they have to come in like do they want to stay at home do they have the option to stay home if they want to what I've been told by the cleaners that I've spoken to is that their employer in some cases well first of all employer they technically don't have an employer because they've all been misclassified which again means they have no protection under our labor laws do they have two choice I mean yeah they could stay home but it means they are not gonna get paid and you know they could potentially just lose whatever work they had so the workers who I spoke to said I have to go in like I don't have a choice I have to you know actually pay my rent and have to pay my bills [Music] the last thing I wanted to talk to you about today and I mean you could talk about this forever because there are so many different kinds of workers that are being impacted by this but I wanted to talk to you about grocery store workers because that's also a job that suddenly become very dangerous you know people are washing their groceries before they bring them into the house so I can't imagine what it's like for people whose job it is to interact with hundreds of customers a day right now and you know restock these shelves and how they must be feeling what I'm sort of hearing from that sector is again these jobs that we are so reliant on right now are some of our lowest wage jobs at least some retail staff in Ontario do have a union which you know provides some layer of protection in some cases some of the larger grocery stores have offered you know the $2 an hour extra wage boost but what I'm sort of hearing both from workers and from members of the public I have to say are writing in and saying you know I don't think $2 an hour is enough for the risk that's being taken here you know a frequent comment that I get from workers and readers is you're seeing retail staff who are often elderly and potentially much more vulnerable to the virus that are still out there working and interacting with the public you do see some measures being taken like the plastic screens that we're seeing but it certainly has not alleviated a lot of the fears around going in to work and the feeling that the added protection is sometimes not enough or not proportionate to the risk that's being taken and just to go through some of the measures that some of these grocery chains have been taking they include things like sanitizing carts and baskets putting down the hours that these stores are open to allow for more cleaning installing Plexiglas at the registers like you mentioned some stores have put physical sensing markers on the ground to remind people to keep their distance they're doing crowd control and stores you getting directions away you can go and when you go there's too many people down one aisle if they know you can't go down there right now wait they're doing a good job but obviously this is not consistent and what do you think is still missing in terms of protections are there specific things that people are saying me to be done right now I mean I think it goes back to like some of the bigger structural issues that pre-existed kovat and will probably continue to exist post KO bid for workers who are still working at minimum wage who may not have access to paid sick days those are kind of like the bigger structural things that determine whether you feel safe saying no to a job that you think is unsafe or you know saying no I'm not gonna stock this today because I don't think appropriate cleaning measures have being taken or I'm not going to come in today because I feel sick and I don't want to risk infecting others really the answer is probably going to come at a legislative level sort of mandating that these protections are applied evenly across the sector otherwise again it's going to depend on the goodwill of individual employers [Music] in terms of health and safety precautions we do have experience with pandemics we have experience from SARS the stars commission that looked into Ontario's response to the SARS crisis really identified the Ministry of Labour as being missing in action as being totally sidelined from the precautions that were taken in workplaces to keep them safe and that was identified as a huge issue in terms of putting workers and then you know by tension the public at risk you know it said in like very clear terms that the ministry has to be present in terms of like enforcing safety obligations and that includes protection from illnesses like SARS or kovat and any other kind of like viral infection or Legionnaires disease anything like that and I think you know what a lot of worker advocates would say is this is a textbook example of why we need proactive rigorous enforcement from the Ministry of Labour sorry thanks so much for doing this we really appreciate it no problem [Music] all right that's the show thanks so much for listening but before we go just a quick note that we now have more details on the 75% wage subsidy that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced last week today he said any company regardless of size including non profits could be eligible for the subsidy if your businesses revenues have decreased by at least 30 percent because of kovat 19 you will be eligible for this subsidy the number of employees you have will not determine whether or not you get this support it will apply to nonprofit organizations and charities as well as companies both big and small the government will cover up to 75 percent of your salary up to the first fifty eight thousand seven hundred dollars that you earn in other words up to eight hundred and forty seven dollars a week and this will be back dated to March 15th and that's all for today I'm Tamera Ken Decker and I'll talk to you tomorrow
