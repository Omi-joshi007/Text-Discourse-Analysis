[Music] hey everyone and welcome to the rising stars podcast today i am with jackie yamada um from our japan headquarters he is our assistant manager of new products so jackie welcome to the podcast um like i said you're coming to us all the way from japan where the star headquarters is based can you tell me more about your background at star and what you're currently doing today yep absolutely so thank you for having bibliana so i'm very excited to join the rising star podcast so you know i am an assistant manager of new product management and development at star migrants japan headquarter and my work my job is like you know every day i am thinking about you know our future product and solutions and strategy so let me share my history at star micronics very quickly so i joined star 12 years ago and at first i was in charge of the sales department of small component division like john levy and such as you know the micro speaker are for automotive automotive companies and cell phone manufacturer and nine years ago you know i moved to the pos printer division which is our current division today and then i experienced the domestic sales and global product product development team at headquarter and then as you know uh three years ago i joined the star migrants america as a customer solutions engineer in the marketing team and the product team and it was amazing you know experience amazing time for me and my family and recently a few few months ago i came back to japan from the us and now i'm working at the headquarter in japan again so my biggest work at the start was you know as you know i created m collection blend concept same collection is the leading impulse peripheral blunt which has m-pop and mc print printer and other peripherals of the coral product and fortunately so we have a lot of users who use the m collection blonde product in the world today so i'm very happy and you know and now i'm working on the next new concept product and the core of my activity is bringing the physical concept sample to our customers and i get their feedback and based on their feedback we will be able to improve our concept again and launch it that is my job today okay wow it sounds like you've had a lot of different responsibilities and roles yes yes obviously such a big contribution to where we are today yes yes and i really miss the american life you know i want to go there again in the near future we miss you too so i mean obviously there's been so much um change in the world the last couple of years kind of why you guys ended up going to back to japan um when you did so one of the markets that were most heavily affected were restaurants so tell me about what the restaurant market looks like today in japan sure so uh in terms of western industrial situation in japan so uh since i have been in the u.s a few months ago i can compare the situation you know the i think there are some same things same trends and different things compared to the u.s situation so first of all take talking about the same trend of course the restaurant industry in japan was affected a lot by pandemic like you know locked down by government order and a stop dying experience and putting the shield barrier in the middle of the table and sanitizer is everywhere and you know you know the key point is that the food delivery is growing lucky tree and in addition you know the qsl restaurant big chain restaurant who are good at the takeaway meal like mcdonald's are doing well i i think you guys have the same situation in the u.s right yeah yep yep and on the other hand you know the different thing is you know that i think uh the different thing is flexibility of the restaurant operation so for example you know from my experience the outs outdoor dying experience is everywhere except for the winter season in the u.s you know during the pandemic the restaurants were utilizing the outside space such as the parking area to set the temporary outdoor dining space right so i do remember uh when i was in the in the us that my wife and kids really like i hope you know i hope and then you know they were really sad because we're missing the dying experience that i have however you know i do remember i hope this set up tables in the parking space immediately once the pandemic coming so it was so impressive but in japan you know it's almost import impossible because you know we have small land you know i'm in the limited spaces and we have a lot small stores so you know and it's better than the past but still country's majority in japan and you know in the japanese izakaya it's kind of the bar in the u.s so the consumers order food several times individually instead of you know the order at one time at the beginning so meaning that you know we have many contacts still so i mean very we are very far from the contact like less experience so in japan you know they have not been able to change the application quickly but i think slowly changes are happening so in summary in my feeling you know i think the japanese restaurants are still in the very difficult situation than the us uh you know the since the percentage of the people who got the vaccine is still quite low i guess it's less than five percent still and you know i also get that the restaurant in japan who do not have the good finance situation will be maybe bankrupt so you know today we are in the fourth wave of copy 19 now in japan so we'll continue to be facing difficulty yeah that's that's really hard to hear um so are a lot of the restaurants in japan still closed up or are they open for limited capacity dining correct track of course it depends on the area so you know especially for the big city like tokyo or osaka they are facing the really difficult situation so they have to stop their you know operation uh this time yeah yeah that's that's tough um well i mean some of the restaurants in the u.s have you know they have faced similar situations but a lot of them have kind of coped with the having to close the dine in portion of their restaurant through online ordering so all my ordering really took off it was a huge trend before the pandemic and now it's even bigger so do you see this trend um also growing in the rest of the world as well yes yes it's a good question and it's a good timing to talk about this question because you know i just had a meeting with our sales companies in each legion last month you know they're coming from u.s no so of course we had a zoo meeting instead of the physical meeting but they are coming from the us you guys you know sma and from europe southeast asia china and hong kong and japan and they all said like you know the food delivery is growing lavatory so of course some differences in each region but you know i can't say it's definitely the global trend and the pandemic and you know the because of uh we have food delivery customers globally so we could see the trend of each region so i think the us and the china are the most leading area other regions such as europe and asia have also the growing trend and the interesting is that you know i have never seen the global trend of our industry is completely same at the same time so that's why i could understand easily how food delivery impacted all persons who live in the hospitality industry and in addition you know i could see some trends such as ghost kitchen and the meal kit delivery i mean the pre-cooked food delivery and the caddies kitchen display system and the self-ordering kiosk and qr code ordering etc so uh that's the interesting thing and back to the food liberal thing so you know i want to touch this thing you know in each legion you know many players have been joined into this world who do deliberate world so i feel like you know each vendor have their own strengths strategy meaning that you know you know for them you know who is their first priority so let's say vendor a is focusing on the customer consumer i mean and the vendor b their first priority is maybe lestrange and bender c is maybe driver focus so of course ideally they want to achieve all of things at the same time but maybe you know in my feeling there is a different different strategy for each and every i have one you know slowly and as an example so i went to the local lecture uh who just started using using solar particles system and i asked them like you know do you prefer this system the food delivery system and they said like you know yes but i said like you know but what maybe you like this service but you don't want to pay additional fee for them and they said like you know we like this system because they bring some orders up to us but you know we are scared of delivery orders when it's coming up okay and i said what do you mean what why do you scare of them you know and then after talking with them i finally i understood their concerns so the reason why they are scared of is sometimes the driver makes a complaint to the restaurant due to the waiting time okay and then you know therefore they prefer this they prefer this system but they are really scared you know i got an important comment from them you know they said like you know we always appreciate for everyone like drivers but we should have win-win relationship i'm so impressed you know the warring win-win relationship i think that's the key word and you know after that you know i suggest of course we are the prince of manufacturer you know i suggest it for them to use the printer to check the older items to avoid mistake you know because they did not purchase the seven or ten inch big big screen tablet you know to set to save the money and they are using their own private smart home which has a small five inch screen and in that case you know sometimes they do not scroll down to the bottom of all order items on you know the small screen and then they miss some food items that makes mistakes and clash between the lesson on drivers and after installing the printer the good thing is they got better experience and what i learned from this comment is that you know we we should bring some solution to avoid any clash between those players then the key point is you know these services will be truly sustainable ecosystem i think and and you know then talking about the relationship i think the relationship is really really really important point and it's also you know important between the restaurant and the consumer however you know in the online ordering it is not so easy to create it by just providing the food to be a driver right so brianna if you are the customer of the food delivery services you just got the food from the driver and then open the bag and eat food that's it right so you don't have any physical experience in that world so you know it already relates to the ux customer experience but no chance to talk or give them some physical experience so you know i know sometimes the restaurant put a handwriting letter in the back to make fans but i'm not sure whether it makes them repeaters so the restaurant today also thinking about the marketing things but it's also tough thing and in the case of food delivery you know the emerging you have a huge if you are the restaurant owner and you have a huge advertisement opportunity like you know let's say tv show and you know the fortunately you got the maybe 1 000 fans libidos but if those 1000 funds are you know the 20 miles far from your restaurant it's almost no meaning right because you know in the case of amazon and you sell the goods not the food it's fine even if your customer is located 20 miles from right you just send your goods to them beer you know fedex or whatever and but in the case of food delivery we should think about the marketing and advertisement which targets for the people who live in nearby so it's going to be very tough thing and i am always thinking about how we can add something great to promote in the back but still learning to be honest and so you know my observation today is i think there are some challenges in the food delivery experience to brussels uh dining experience yeah that's such interesting insight i of course as a marketer i am always thinking about you know how you can better reach your audience but yes i hadn't really thought about that disconnect between the restaurant and the actual consumers when they're using ordering systems especially because a lot of the online ordering systems that are popularly being used have a driver that doesn't even work for the restaurant so right there's really a major lack of connection and um a difficult way to maintain that customer retention and loyalty so yeah absolutely interesting point um i do want to revisit something that you talked about earlier and that was another trend that you're seeing in the restaurant space and that was ghost kitchens tell me what what is a ghost kitchen and where do you see that trending so the ghost kitchen is like you know we call it as a ghost kitchen or you know the cloud kitchens or whatever but you know especially in the u.s so i have been seeing that trend and the ghost kitchen is the restaurant but they do not have the ex dining experience so they just focus on the you know the food delivery thing you know they have the kitchen uh equipment and they have a you know the real estimate escape things but and you know imagine in one building they have a several restaurant one maybe three or five or seven whatever and then so usually the one restaurant have one chef or two chef only and then they just focus on the cooking and then they got the food orders via the sour party who deliver the application or their own system and then they just cook and then bring it to the customer so that's it so i mean you know the important thing is that you know they do not need to spend much money before they start the restaurant business so it's really simple business model okay interesting i actually have seen a couple of ghost kitchens um in my area i'm i'm really curious continues to trend so we've talked a lot about online ordering and of course i don't think that online ordering is ever going to go away or slow down but people are definitely eager to get back into restaurants for dining experience with their friends and family so what do you think that that's going to look like following the pandemic we hear some people saying that you know eating out is going to slow down in general because it's so easy to just order food and have it delivered or do you think there will need to be new technology involved to make that dining experience more uh you know more appealing to the diners yep great question so i think they have no choice but to adapt new technologies unless that the restaurant has a lot of libidos funds locally you know my toll is that you know the panamic accelerated the food delivery service expanding as a result as you said you know some percentage of the customers shifted to this experience out of all customers in the restaurant industry so i think that after the parliament settled down the dying experience demand will come back but uh as you said you know the food demand never dies so there are basically two cases i observed so the restaurant who could not catch the demand of delivery so they have to save the operation because such a labor cost more and more or the lesson that got success on the delivery so they need to support both operations for delivery and dining experience or of course as you mentioned that the ghost kitchen it's a new business model new business style they do not need to care about the boss experience but i think the most of restaurant want to have a boss experience right so i i think it's how to cover these situations by using the existing legacy system in addition new me is coming up like you know the contact less and the people are already familiar to use their smartphone to place orders so i believe you know changes are unavoidable so i would say that it is important how fast to catch up with the new normal for the lesson and optimize it so not back to normal yeah right i think especially what you mentioned about ordering or viewing the menu on the phone i think that's definitely going to be the new normal yeah yeah i agree with you all right well we're just going to take a really quick break um to talk about the star micronics tsp 654 sk printer so it's time to rethink your label printing with the star micronics tsp tsp6542 sk this

so i want to shift gears a little bit we've talked a lot about the actual restaurants and you know the experience that they're providing to their diners and obviously it's our responsibility as a point-of-sale vendor to kind of assist them with those solutions so what do you think that vendors like us and isbs can do to provide a dep a better dine and experience yes so well you know in terms of dying experience i think the important point is how to provide customer service satisfaction you know i mean the fun experience so user experience so maybe i can say it's kind of the entertainment things on the other hand you know thinking about the in-store application because you know we are the pos hardware and software solution manufacturer so i i am always thinking about the store application so and i suggest at the same time we should think about all things meaning that you know dying experience you know delivery things take away orders you know reservation hospitality uh maybe the food quality serving payment you know the human resource management and ceo blah blah blah and i think you know today you know there are a lot of things right but there are a lot of great services and you know it is possible to combine those all services for example by using apis so but the key point is how to utilize those services as one solution not the one by one individual solution so please imagine your lesson manager both dynamic and delivery customers and let's say you know me myself as a customer so maybe you know let's say this week i order food be a delivery application and next week i go to the physical restaurant and order from the table so that's the same customer it's me but it's not so easy to manage me as a one same customer on the system right so i think it's really critical thing so maybe you might be missing important facts for making your strategy if you cannot analyze this type of fact but on the other hand if you know this fact and maybe you could say to me when i go there you know hey jackie so thank you for coming and thank you for ordering the last week be a dilbert application so maybe you had a party with your friend and how was the food something like that and that that small conversation makes me a little bit happy and more stick to your restaurant so i mean this is the kind of you know the one of the great hospitality thing for me and you know i think the hardware uh i can say the same thing you know as well so imagine you know using the hardware that can be connected to barrier services is much simpler than preparing 10 or more devices that only connect one service one by one right so or you know i think the hardware should be more have a functional function of functionality or uh you know the common trigger interface for all services and how can you know how can our device connect to various services locally or via the cloud easily and seamlessly so that's my point and i'm thinking about how star solution can be that position and how we can contribute to the lesson so that's my thought yep yeah you you bring up a really great point about you know the disconnect again between the online ordering versus dinan like you said order online through delivery service from that restaurant one day and go in the following day and dine in and they have no idea that you were yesterday's customer so there's definitely a need for the online ordering systems to be better integrated with the point of sale or their loyalty and it makes me think of the word omni channel which is so commonly used in everyone talk about how you need a good omni-channel solution or strategy for retail but it's not really talked about in the restaurant space everyone kind of looked at the you know dine-in and online ordering experience really separately and like you said to give customers the full experience that they want they need to come together that's true yep so what other solutions do you think are needed to kind of do that so first of all you know the today there are a lot of great services and there are a lot of web apis so let's say so i think we do not need to think about just one solution provided by only us so we should work together with our partners you know the maybe i can say you know star is really good at this area so like you know of course the printer and some other hardware things and we could make the sdk or some apis as well and then we bring it to the our customers like isbs and then isps combined our solutions and then they make it you know the more you know uh flexible and more valuable so that's my strategy that's my thought so i it is not so easy to say uh what is the right solution today but i believe the working together with our partner is the better way to find out the new normal agreed 100 percent so we talked about some of the other trends um like the qr menus where you on your phone or self-ordering kiosks and more like qsr locations what other trends are you predicting um are going to arise in restaurants that we haven't seen yet yes i have already seen this trend but the qsl menu and it was i guess the self-service kiosk is the difference with the trend but i think you know it's a trend especially for the big chain restaurants and you know because in the us i have been seeing the self-service skills in many places even before pandemic so that's the fact and i think that means the pandemic accelerate lady that that trend but the fact is you know it was fundamental demand of the restaurant especially in the big chain you know the qsr electron you know my point is that you know i am always thinking about how we can bring solutions uh that are already well accepted in the big chain restaurant while two smbs with some modification adjustment for example you know the table order and the payment automation you know so as you mentioned uh like you said you know the qr code ordering at the table is getting familiar in the you know the world but you know the emerging the big chain lesson might be able to install the dedicated ordering terminal on each table but it's really expensive right so for smb restaurant it's really tough to adapt that technology for all their stores and the old table so i mean my point is how can we make solutions for smb how can we you know modify that solution to fit the smb world and this type of things is a big challenge and you know again it's impossible to do so by only our by only start so you know again we should go with the partner you know my wish and my goal is you know i am hoping the future with any type any size of the lesson can get those benefits so i agree yeah it is you know you obviously see the bigger chain restaurants especially in the us um quickly adapting to all of the regulations whether it be you know limited capacity online or ordering on your phone things like that but it yes harder for the smaller restaurants to adapt yes that's my point yep yeah so with all that said what do you think is the future of restaurant solutions where do you see you know the standard restaurant going in five ten years so again in my understanding due to the coffee 19 you know the challenges of the lesson that we are having a long time have selfish clearly so that's a great thing i think you know like labor cost or labor resources and lengthy and now we can call it opportunities instead of the problem so or we can call it the chance to change so i'm sure nobody knows the right answer today but i can see that the solutions in the electron industry are leading the digital transformation and you know the physical experience demand mobile ends so i believe that this industry will lead the technology trend and by having triangular i mean improving so we will be able to find a new normal that realize more far more so you know lastly i really would like to join this opportunity together by showing our new solution ideas and showing the our new concept sample so that's my work so let's work together that sounds great is there anything you can share with us about that today i'm good i'm good but the one thing for the restaurant market for my message is that you know i really love the less fun experience so i love drinking i love eating i love talking with someone you know my family my kids also so you know that make experience makes us happier every time you know i am still learning what new normal should be so let's work together and please give us your real voice and feedback at any time that's my message absolutely well jackie thank you so much for all of your insight i felt like i learned so much about some of the gaps that are currently existing in the restaurant solutions and kind of what we need to do moving forward to solve that and like you said working together will will help that um so thank you again if you anyone wants to connect with jackie further you can find him on linkedin for star micronic you can follow us on linkedin
