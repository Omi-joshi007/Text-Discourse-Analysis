Change on the cards
NORWOOD
THE man behind The Parade’s newest cafe is drawing inspiration from a childhood spent in his grandmother’s kitchen.
Dominic Rocca has opened Cafe Settebello in the old Norwood Baptist church and plans to bring a taste of his nonna’s meals to the Norwood public.
So authentically Italian is the cafe, Nonna Grazia Ceravolo, now 85, can often be found in the kitchen, passing on her cooking tips.
“She pretty much comes into our restaurant and shows our chefs all her secrets,” says Mr Rocca, who has opened the cafe with his father Tony, mother Domie and sisters Anita and Deana.
“We keep it as old school as possible … we want to bring that authentic Italian food that we grew up with to The Parade.” The family started the Settebello brand in 1993 on Pulteney St but sold it to follow other business endeavours, moving first to Amici on Rundle St, then Fellini in O’Connell St and, eventually, Schnithouse, also based at the old Norwood church.
They opened a Cafe Settebello in Campbelltown about three months ago. Settebello is known for its wood oven pizza, coffee made in a traditional Italian macchinetta and homemade olive oil, olives, sauce, bread, desserts and gelati.
Mr Rocca, who has created about 20 jobs at The Parade cafe, says the church reminds him of Italian architecture.
“With its light-filled blue, celestial ceiling and leadlight glass windows, the building may have finally found a home in the Italian cuisine,” he says. “It could easily be reminiscent of the old buildings one may dine in anywhere in Italy.” The name of the cafe is a nod to the Italian card games he played as a child with his grandparents.
“The settebello is the most important card in the deck,” he says. “And a lot of what this cafe is about what our grandparents have taught us and instilled in us, and that includes games.”Adelaide Matters, Page 26
