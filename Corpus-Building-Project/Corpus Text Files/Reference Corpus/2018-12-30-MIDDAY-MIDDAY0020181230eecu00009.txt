Aladdin, the musical, which was produced by BookMyShow in the middle of last year, continues to go strong. Puranjit Dasgupta, who plays Genie, says he doesn't watch the film too often. "Genie was scripted around Robin Williams, not the other way around. Genie is a very interesting character; Aladdin and he share a bond. Aladdin is played by two actors: Siddharth Menon and Taaruk Raina. The young heroes say that the best part about the play is that it's the story of hope — an underdog who finds a full life.

Where: 20 Janki Kutir Juhu Church Road
When: June-July 2019
Kunal Kapoor, who runs Prithvi Theatre today, is reviving seven of his grandfather, Prithviraj Kapoor's, plays. The first one, Deewar, directed by Sunil Shanbag, was staged in November, and the second one, Kisaan, directed by Abhishek Majumdar, will be staged in the new year. "These are things [issues] we're still dealing with today," says Kapoor. "That's why I think they have a life. Definitely, we need to adapt them, [just] like Shakespeare. Prithviraj Kapoor would have 50-60 people onstage; his plays would go on for four-and-a-half hours. That's not feasible today. So, you need to edit them and bring them up to speed. The idea is [to have] a director's interpretation or his approach to the classics."

What: Dutch photography at CSMVS
Where: Jehangir Nicholson Art Foundation, CSMVS, Fort
When: Till February 10
Entry: Rs 85
Still/Life at JNAF presents the Dutch obsession with the humble, the boring, the drab. Sixteen photographers are represented in the show, with 48 photographs and five videos, with a thread of irony binding them all. Marcel Feil, curator of the show, says about the Bouquet series (pictured above), which is a shot of cutouts of flowers and fruits, "For most people, these are visually related to the Dutch painterly tradition of still-life painting in the 17th century, with flowers and fruits. But, it's not what you think it is. The original paintings are appreciated because of their naturalistic qualities. In the 17th century, when an artist decided to paint fruit, it was quite exceptional, because fruit in itself is not so special."

A hoppumm is a marriage between Sri Lanka's hoppers, a type of fermented pancakes, and South Indian appams, and three school friends from Bombay Scottish brought it to Bandra this year. Hoppumm is a 15-seater restaurant, exuding architectural influences from Sri Lanka. The highlight is the bowl-shaped Sri Lankan pancakes filled with a range of fragrant curries. To make it flexible, they offer combinations where you can pair a base staple — hopper, string hopper (idiyappam), neer dosa, paratha or kothu roti — with a flavourful filling.

Mastani is a milkshake that comes topped with a dollop of hand-churned ice cream. Some people also add fresh cut fruits, dry fruits and whipped cream. It is believed that when guests tried it for the first time, they would exclaim 'masta'. It has become a part of Pune's food heritage, and you can now try it at a tiny dessert parlour in Vile Parle called Karandikar Mastani House. A simple store with a couple of chairs, this Mastani house offers eight flavours starting from mango to the interesting Irish pudding Mastani.
