Michael Caines opens his new luxury country hotel
THE doors at what is hoped to become the best country house hotel in the country have now opened.
Celebrity chef Michael Caines has spent the past two years transforming Courtlands House, near Lympstone, into a luxury 21-bedroom hotel and restaurant with three dining rooms and its own vineyard.
A £8.5m refurbishment and extension of Lympstone Manor has taken place and Michael has transformed the Georgian Grade II listed mansion overlooking the Exe Estuary.
The Exeter-born businessman, who has been awarded the Freedom of the City and an MBE for his achievements, is aiming to make it the best country house hotel in the country.
It opened for a soft launch on Monday and is welcoming guests while final work continues ready for its official opening on April 3.
At the launch Michael said: “This is a fantastic project to do and we have fully restored it for all of you to come and dine and stay.
“It has been a massive effort by us and we hope you will enjoy and appreciate it.
“It is a fantastic property full of charm and luxury and we look forward to welcome you. I have created some new and old dishes for you to enjoy.
“Lympstone Manor consists of 21 individual bedrooms that have been beautifully restored, and of course, we have amazing views over the Exe Estuary.”
Previously he has said: “The responsibility of running a project of this size certainly isn’t lost on me and the team. It’s a very exciting project for me – it’s a dream come true.
“We will create about 60 to 80 jobs through this scheme over the next few years.
“I’m very excited about creating something of beauty in the landscape of East Devon.”
Booking are already being taken to stay at the hotel.
