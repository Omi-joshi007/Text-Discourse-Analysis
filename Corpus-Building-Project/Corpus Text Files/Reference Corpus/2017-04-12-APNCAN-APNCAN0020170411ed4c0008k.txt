Dine in at new KFC restaurant
COLLINS Foods Limited has opened a brand new KFC at 173 Station Road Burpengary, creating 60 new jobs for the area.
Residents are invited to visit the new restaurant to enjoy the modern dining facilities and contemporary furnishings, inspired by a Queensland-based interior designer.
The restaurant has also met high environmental sustainability standards evident through its rainwater tanks, lighting design, insulation usage, construction materials, refrigeration and mechanical systems, cooking equipment and waste management and recycling processes.
To enhance the customer’s in-store experience, the front counter includes digital menu board technology and the latest streamlined method of service to simplify the ordering process.
Customers have the option of dining at the restaurant which has seating for 50, or using the restaurant’s drive-through which features a fast and efficient order, pay, pick-up system.
Matthew Shailer, restaurant general manager for KFC Burpengary, said he was excited to unveil the restaurant and provide a high level of service enhanced by the new facilities.
“Brisbane’s northern suburbs are growing rapidly and we are delighted to open a brand new, energy-efficient restaurant and employ many local people,” he said.
The new restaurant is part of Collins Foods’ long-term expansion and upgrade program which includes a number of new and remodelled KFC restaurants.
“The enhanced restaurant features are all designed to improve the customer experience,” said Collins Foods’ chief executive officer, Graham Maxwell.
