How People Ordered Meals Online in 2022, According to DoorDash

It seems everyone craves takeout lately-and the numbers prove it. A recent report from online food ordering company DoorDash found a 15% year-over-year growth for same-store pickup orders using their app and an 11% growth for same-store delivery orders. Additionally, 37% of respondents ordered delivery more often than last year, and 41% said the same for picking up an order, according to 2022 survey data.
Interest doesn't just stop there: 37% of consumers dined indoors more often than last year, and nearly 1 in 5 decided to dine al fresco more often. Whether eating at a restaurant or taking a meal to go, the message seems clear-diners value the simplicity of not having to cook a meal themselves as life slowly comes back to "normal" after the onset of the pandemic.
According to the National Restaurant Association, 62% of adults said they're more likely to order takeout or delivery now compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic. Industry sales are expected to hit $898 billion in 2022, but the industry continues to struggle with the repercussions of food shortages during the pandemic years. Six percent of operators experienced supply delays or shortages of key food or beverage items in 2021, and supply chain challenges have continued through 2022.

We looked at trends in how people ordered meals online in 2022, according to data from DoorDash[https://get.doordash.com/en-us/resources/restaurant-online-ordering-trends] and research from industry sources like the National Restaurant Association[https://go.restaurant.org/SOI2022-DoorDash.html].
People valued a good ordering experience, accurate delivery time, and fast service

A DoorDash report found nearly 3 in 4 consumers chose a delivery method based on the quality of experience, 69% stated the importance of an accurate delivery time, and 69% valued quality customer service.
Plus, while customers could call a restaurant to order, nearly all enjoyed using a third-party app that allowed them to save their delivery information for easy checkout. Almost half said they enjoyed the convenience of having their delivery information saved (up 9% from 2021), and 44% said they wanted to be able to re-order their last meal easily. Easy checkout processes were also valued, with 41% stating they enjoyed having their payment information saved to make future orders with a click of a button.

Breakfast saw an increase in popularity
Although takeout is popularly seen as an option for lunch and dinner, early risers also sought convenient options to get a meal in the morning.

Consumers don't call to order anymore
Thirty-seven percent of consumers said they preferred ordering through a third-party delivery platform-up 10% compared to 2021. Only 18% of consumers preferred calling a restaurant directly, down from 27% last year.
Some consumers still ordered from the restaurant-but without picking up the phone.
