A breakdown of some of the restaurants we lost this year — and what's replacing them
How does that Tennyson poem go? Ah yes, "Tis better to have loved and lost. Than never to have loved at all."
While I know he wasn't writing about restaurants, it certainly rings true.
We've lost some well-loved Louisville area restaurants over the course of 2021. The coronavirus pandemic continues to rage on, making staffing shortages, supply chain issues and commodity inflation all the more troubling.
Let's take a look back at some of the eateries we said goodbye to this year and a few concepts we'll be saying hello to in 2022.
Hammerheads — Highlands
Hammerheads closed its Highlands location at 2222 Dundee Road in November. This space previously housed Migo, before Hammerheads moved in last year. The Hammerheads in Germantown remains open at 921 Swan St. Meanwhile, the owners of Limón Y Sal have purchased the building for a second location[https://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/news/2021/12/07/lim-n-y-sal-mexican-kitchen-plans-second-location.html].
Tony Impellizzeri’s Pizza
Tony Impellizzeri retired after 42 years in the pizza business in November. Impellizzeri decided to close his New Albany restaurant, Tony Impellizzeri’s Pizza, in May because his lease was ending. After some soul searching, Impellizzeri decided at 68 he could not commit to spending five more years in such a labor-intensive business.
Hog Father Pizza
Newer Butchertown restaurant Hog Father Pizza announced its permanent closure in November[https://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/news/2021/11/04/butchertown-restaurant-closes-after-seven-months-i.html]. Owner Andy Blieden blamed the decision on staffing shortages and the general impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the dining scene. The building at 1301 Story Ave. has also been home to Hall’s Cafeteria and Butchertown Pizza Hall in recent years.
Highland Coffee Co.
Highland Coffee Co., a fixture at 1140 Bardstown Road, announced its closure after 22 years in business in September. The coffee shop, owned by Greg and Natalie Hofer, shared its nearly 10,000-square-foot space with Urban Outfitters.
Mango’s Mexican Grill & Cantina
Mango’s Mexican Grill & Cantina closed in August after being unable to renew its lease at 6201 Dutchmans Lane. The restaurant shared in the same post that it was looking for a new location and may already have a site in mind.
Royals Hot Chicken — Jeffersontown
Nashville-style hot chicken chain Royals Hot Chicken closed its Jeffersontown location in August after 17 months of difficulties during the pandemic. The 2,500-square-foot restaurant on Taylorsville Road, which was a Moby Dick location prior to Royals taking it over, underwent an extensive remodel leading up to its opening.
That’s My Dog
That's My Dog, a hot dog joint located just steps away from the Big Four Bridge in Downtown Jeffersonville, Indiana, closed in August. Owner Thomas Harris said labor and food shortages have plagued That's My Dog in recent months, and sales just weren't strong enough to keep the brick-and-mortar location open. There's a new concept there now from Southern Hospitality Group[https://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/news/2021/09/29/bocce-bowl-to-open.html], Bocce Bowl, which owns nearby Union Restaurant & Gameyard.
Butchertown Grocery
Butchertown Grocery announced the indefinite closure of its Washington Street restaurant in June. The eatery, which opened in late 2015 to rave reviews, has been closed to dine-in business since the start of Covid-19 in mid-March 2020. Bobby Benjamin, one of Butchertown Grocery’s founding partners and its executive chef, accepted a job outside of Louisville.
Atlantic No. 5
Atlantic No. 5 closed its doors at 605 W. Main St. in May after more than five years in business. Good news though: Wiltshire Pantry is preparing to open in that same space. Wiltshire's new downtown cafe initially plans to be open from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday, with the potential for Saturdays depending on the traffic levels[https://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/news/2021/08/06/wiltshire-downtown-louisville.html].
Jimmy Can’t Dance/Another Place Sandwich Shop
Jimmy Can't Dance and Another Place Sandwich Shop at 119 S. Seventh St. shuttered in February and March, respectively. Fortunately, those spots have already reopened as The Flamingo Lounge and Against the Grain Sandwich Emporium.
Jeff’s Burger Shack
Jeff's Burger Shack, located at 14126 Dixie Highway, closed on March 1. The Dixie Highway property was formerly home to A&W Restaurant & Ice Creamery and features a drive-in style overhang in the parking lot. The lot is nearly 7,500 square feet.
Martin’s Bar-B-Que Joint
Martin's Bar-B-Que Joint, a Tennessee-based barbecue chain, decided to close its location at 984 Barret Ave. at the end of January after just over two years in business. This site, formerly home to Lynn’s Paradise Café, will soon become Big Bad Breakfast[https://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/news/2021/07/28/endeavor-restaurant-group-big-bad-breakfast.html], a concept founded by James Beard Award-winning Chef John Currence.
Adrienne & Co.
Bakery and café Adrienne & Co. closed its location at 133 E. Market St. in New Albany at the end of January. In addition to cakes and other baked goods, Adrienne & Co. offered a full breakfast and lunch menu in New Albany, which included sandwiches, salads and other entrees.
O’Charley’s — Jeffersontown, St. Matthews
O’Charley’s closed two Louisville area locations in 2021, including 10641 Fischer Park Drive and 962 Breckenridge Lane. The Fischer Park Drive location will soon become a joint First Watch and LaRosa’s Pizzeria[https://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/news/2021/11/17/first-watch-larosas-joint-restaurant.html], according to plans filed in November.
