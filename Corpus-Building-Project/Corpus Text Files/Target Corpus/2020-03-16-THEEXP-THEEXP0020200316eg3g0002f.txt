Chinese restaurants 'crying out for help'
CHINESE restaurants across the country are struggling as Covid-19 fears keep diners at home.
Restaurant owners and business representatives in Birmingham, Manchester and London are reporting takings down by as much as 75 per cent.
Some eateries are taking drastic measures to reduce staffing costs, such as lay offs and reduced hours, while other resturants have closed.
James Wong, 45, managing director of Chung Ying Restaurant group and chairman of Southside Business Improvement District in Birmingham, said: "This week, with the government's announcements, the effect has started to really hit home for my businesses.
"I've seen takings drop 70-75 per cent.
"We are crying out for support after being one of the hardest hit sectors for five weeks.
"I'm quite frustrated because I've got 70-80 staff who are reliant on me to provide for their families but this affects my family as well.
"I'm trying my best to get people to come out, calm down and give moral support to Chinese businesses."
