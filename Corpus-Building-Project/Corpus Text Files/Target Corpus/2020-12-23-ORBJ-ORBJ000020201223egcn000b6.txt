Delivery services drive Orlando restaurateurs to expand concepts — sans dining rooms
Got a hankering for fries? How about chips and guac?
Apparently, you're not alone as Orlando diners had their fill of the food and drink items they most craved even while complying with stay-at-home orders established during the pandemic — thanks to meal delivery companies like Uber Eats, DoorDash, Grubhub and Postmates.
In fact, meal delivery has become so popular, it kicked off a new trend of "ghost kitchens," or virtual kitchens, in which a restaurant or brand physically exists only as a production-and-distribution point with no space for dine-in customers. So, meals are just cooked and packaged to be picked up or delivered.

In Orlando, it began even before the coronavirus overtook our lives. In January, British-born businessman and Planet Hollywood founder Robert Earl rolled out[https://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/news/2020/01/31/delivery-only-chicken-wings-concept-launches-in.html] Wing Squad[https://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/news/2020/01/31/delivery-only-chicken-wings-concept-launches-in.html], a delivery-only restaurant that uses third-party meal-delivery platforms exclusively to send chicken wings, sides and desserts to customers. It was just the latest of Earl's Orlando-based Virtual Dining Concepts LLC platform, which was incorporated in May 2019.
And once the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in many people either being mandated to stay at home — or choosing to do so to avoid catching the virus — the virtual kitchen concepts grew. Here's what a couple of big-name local restaurateurs have going.
Johnny Tung doesn't just want to boost his own business. He wants to create a more progressive foodie environment in Central Florida.
Tung and his business partners in the Bento Asian Kitchen + Sushi restaurant chain — Jimmy Tung, Sean “Sonny” Nguyen and David Yu — opened a combination virtual kitchen and chef concept incubator in Orlando's Conway neighborhood dubbed Collab Kitchens. The 2,400-square-foot kitchen in a Publix-anchored shopping center on the corner of Curry Ford and Conway roads is churning out meals from their own established restaurant, Bento.
It's also doing some spinoffs and chef-driven concepts, namely Lucky Dragon, Domu Wings (a spinoff by Nguyen from Domu restaurant) and Uncle Sung’s Chicken & Rice. Along with giving diners options from the well-known Bento brand[https://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/news/2018/12/14/how-this-orlando-sushi-restaurant-co-owner-went.html] — which just opened its 20th location — the ghost kitchen allows chefs to test their food concepts without the high costs of brick-and-mortar locations and labor, Johnny Tung told Orlando Business Journal.
"Even before the pandemic, delivery and online sales were increasing every year. With the pandemic, everyone started downloading delivery apps so they don’t have to leave their houses to get the food they want. And it's good for the restaurants and chefs because you’re basically running online."
Collab Kitchens currently features six chefs, and the goal is have 15 different virtual concepts running out of this one kitchen that Tung calls a “virtual food hall.” Customers can order any of the dishes they want from all these brands and pick their meal up in the same place — or have it delivered, he said.
This is just the first phase of the renamed Omei Restaurant Group LLC's (formerly Bento Management Group) grand plan to boost Orlando's food cachet. Once the virtual concepts are successful, the next step would be for those chefs to move into Omei's planned 4,000-square-foot food hall being built out on Colonial Drive in downtown, Tung told OBJ.
The food hall, part of Omei's 10,000-square-foot headquarters building, will feature roughly 10 vendors who, if successful here, will move on to the third phase: getting into a brick-and-mortar restaurant space, Tung said. The restaurant group's owners really hope to provide mentorship and resources to restaurateurs who can add to the Central Florida industry, he said.
"We really want to see how we can change Orlando’s food scene — that's our higher calling. All the spotlight goes to the food scenes in Miami, Atlanta, New Orleans. But we want Orlando to get that national recognition of being a foodie city. So, instead of putting all our resources into Bento, we're slowing our expansion and focusing on Orlando. We love Orlando. That’s why we chose Mills 50 for our food hall; we want to build it into a food cultural center in Orlando."
Orlando barbecue king John Rivers has a new concept in the works — but he's not on the lookout for restaurant space.
Rather, the founder and CEO of Winter Park-based 4R Restaurant Group LLC and his team are developing a line of chicken wings and burgers. These items typically aren't on the menus of his 4 Rivers Smokehouse or The Coop restaurants, but they are the highest categories driving this segment of the business, he said. The plan is to house those delivery-only meals under a separate brand name, not affiliated with 4 Rivers or The Coop, and offer the brand statewide in next year's first quarter, he said.
"When people now are shopping for food on Uber Eats and DoorDash, they're not necessarily looking for a particular restaurant brand but more what they're in the mood for," 4 Rivers Smokehouse founder John Rivers said in a previous interview, adding that he's got a concept in the works. "It’s a whole different psychology of where you're going to eat than before."

Uber Eats announced it joined with Chicago-based research and consulting firm Technomic in collecting insights from more than 400 restaurant owners in the U.S. and Canada through surveys and interviews. Results showed that restaurants are relying on Uber Eats in ways they hadn't before and there was a "dramatic increase" in the number of people ordering meals from their favorite restaurants through the Uber Eats app, the company reported.
Some of the other findings included:
* 82% of restaurant operators said Uber Eats has been crucial to business during Covid-19.
* 75% of operators said that they would have had to close their businesses if not for Uber Eats.
* 81% would have had to lay off staff members if not for third-party delivery.
* 92% of operators report that they plan to continue working with third-party delivery services post crisis, including 88% of those that joined recently.
* 92% of restaurants surveyed said Eats provided proactive support like waiving consumer delivery fees and daily payout options during the crisis.
