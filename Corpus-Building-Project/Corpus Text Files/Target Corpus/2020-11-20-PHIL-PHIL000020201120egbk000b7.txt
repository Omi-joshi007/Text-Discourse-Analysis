Quick-service restaurant company Fat Brands launches Philadelphia ghost kitchen at facility from Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick
A global franchising company specializing in fast-casual concepts has expanded its footprint in the Philadelphia market with a new ghost kitchen outpost in Mantua.
Fat Brands Inc., which operates 700 franchise locations across 30 countries, has taken to the West Philly neighborhood to introduce its first ghost kitchen location in the region, which will offer menus from the company’s Elevation Burger and Hurricane Grill & Wings concepts. Los Angeles-based Fat Brands owns seven other quick-service restaurant chains: Fatburger, Johnny Rockets, Buffalo’s Cafe, Buffalo’s Express, Yalla Mediterranean and Ponderosa and Bonanza steakhouses.
As a ghost kitchen, the Mantua location strictly operates on a takeout and delivery basis, foregoing any dine-in service. This is the first ghost kitchen for Elevation Burger, which already sells organic burgers nearby in Willow Grove, Collegeville and Wyomissing. It’s also the first Pennsylvania location of Hurricane Grill & Wings, a chain known for wings available in 35 signature sauces and rubs.
Operated by franchisee Chris Phillips, who owns two other Elevation Burger locations, the ghost kitchen takes up residence at 3300 Fairmount Ave.
The Mantua facility falls under the umbrella of CloudKitchens, a startup from Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick, who has since cut ties with the ride-share company. Kalanick has invested more than $130 million to build out 40 ghost kitchen locations in commercial properties like warehouses and shuttered restaurants across the U.S., The Wall Street Journal reported.[https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-founder-turns-real-estate-mogul-for-ghost-kitchen-startup-11603186200]
The Philadelphia location plays home to a number of other ghost kitchens for brands including Burger King, sandwich concept Get Melt’d and barbecue spot Smoked and Chopped. It also has two concepts from New York City celebrity chef Franklin Becker: Shai, an Israeli-inspired virtual eatery, and Sicilian pie concept Benny Casanova’s.
Co-branding the Philly ghost kitchen with two Fat Brands concepts enhances menu diversity and accelerates the entry of two distinct brands into one new market, said Fat Brands CEO Andy Wiederhorn. Fat Brands has more than 100 other co-branded locations of its various brands across the country, a model which Wiederhorn notes has been “very successful” for the company.
Operating a ghost kitchen during the Covid-19 pandemic is efficient and “checks all the boxes” customers are looking for as interest in takeout and delivery grows during the health crisis, he noted.
Launching a ghost kitchen can also save big on fixed costs. Building out a ghost kitchen stall for a brand in a shared facility may run $200,000 to $300,000, Wiederhorn said, with an emphasis on kitchen equipment. The move effectively saves a company the funds it would typically shell out for a dining room, tables and chairs, and bathrooms for guests.
“But that's not a short-term investment," Wiederhorn noted. “We want these customers to learn about our brand, enjoy the product [and] come back over and over again.”
Wiederhorn estimates operators can cut labor costs by 40% with a ghost kitchen because there is no dining room to attend to.
He also said that while he doesn’t believe customers have any expectations for a dining experience when ordering from a ghost kitchen, he doesn’t think the locations work well for unknown brands.
“I don't think ghost kitchens work for a brand that nobody knows of because you're just going to see it on a delivery app and say, ‘What’s that? I’ve never heard of [it],’” Wiederhorn noted. “... So you’re capturing your brand awareness of existing customers who are familiar with your brand, making it available to them in their area for delivery.”
Across its footprint, Fat Brands will close out 2020 with having opened about 57 new locations throughout the year. Roughly 12 of those will be ghost kitchens.
While they gained popularity ahead of the coronavirus outbreak in spring, ghost kitchens have reached new heights in Greater Philadelphia in the age of Covid-19. Fine-Drawn Hospitality, the group behind The Post and Walnut Street Cafe, in October opened virtual ghost kitchen food hall The Commons[https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2020/10/08/the-commons-virtual-ghost-food-hall.html] out in University City. Meanwhile, Nantucket-born quick-service chain Oath Pizza recently took to 1308 W. Girard Ave.[https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2020/10/29/oath-pizza-ghost-kitchen-fairmount-opens.html] to launch the first ghost kitchen in the company's portfolio of about 60 concepts.
Other local eateries to jump on the ghost kitchen trend this year include Stephen Starr and Peter Serpico’s Asian-inspired concept Serpico, which pivoted during the crisis to reopen as a new ghost kitchen[https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2020/10/06/serpico-reopens-ghost-kitchen-petes-place.html] noodle concept. Similarly, Glu Hospitality has used the kitchen at its Vesper Sporting Club in Center City to operate a virtual restaurant[https://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2020/04/30/local-nightlife-group-to-debut-fried-chicken.html] for its Hunnie’s Crispy Chicken brand.
