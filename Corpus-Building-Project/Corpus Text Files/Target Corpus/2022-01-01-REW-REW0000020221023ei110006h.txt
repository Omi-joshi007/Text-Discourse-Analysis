OUR CHANGING RELATIONSHIP WITH MEAL DELIVERY APPS
Mason discusses the significant increase in usage of food delivery apps in Australia, highlighting ways for brands to capitalize on the channel to engage consumers in new ways. In October 2021, Nature conducted the third wave of its 'Meal Delivery and Convenience' study among a representative sample of 1000 Australians. The research sought to uncover macro trends in Australians' food consumption habits and understand their relationships with meal delivery and other convenience channels, such as online grocery. The research found that consumers' approach to food has shifted compared with pre-Covid times. The drivers of usage have been consistent over recent years. Users of meal delivery apps are attracted by the sheer convenience, variety choice, and the indulgent experience that these services provide.
