The Dutch police clash with anti-lockdown protesters in Amsterdam.
AMSTERDAM — The riot police used water cannons, batons, attack dogs and officers on horseback on Sunday to disperse hundreds of people throwing fireworks and stones in protest against the Dutch government and its coronavirus measures.
The protest followed the resignation[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/15/world/europe/dutch-government-resignation-rutte-netherlands.html] of Prime Minister Mark Rutte and his cabinet on Friday over the Dutch tax authority’s treatment of poor families amid a child-care benefits scandal.
The protesters gathered on a central square lined with famous museums, including the Van Gogh Museum[https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en], and the American Consulate, waving placards saying “Dictatorship,” “Freedom” and “We are the Netherlands.”
Video footage showed very few wearing masks, which are not mandatory in the open air, and no one keeping a social distance of five feet, one of the key health measures advised by the Dutch authorities.
Like most of Europe, the Netherlands is in a lockdown, at least until Feb. 9. Infections remain high but the rate has slightly[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html] dropped, with 34 coronavirus cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
Those protesting the social restrictions are a relatively small but vocal coterie of groups and individuals opposed to Mr. Rutte and his policies, and also angry at established media organizations. Much like the Trump loyalists who stormed the United States Capitol, they believe the system needs to be uprooted.
“These people live in their own truth, with their own news and own reality,” said Hans Nijenhuis, the editor in chief of The Algemeen Dagblad[https://www.ad.nl/], the largest newspaper in the Netherlands. “As we have seen in the States, we can’t just ignore their discontent.”
An application to hold Sunday’s protest filed by Michel Reijinga, who was mustering supporters on Facebook, was rejected by officials. To prevent the spread of the coronavirus, all such gatherings have been prohibited in the country.
Hundreds — perhaps thousands, according to the organizers — nonetheless gathered at the central Museumplein square, prompting[https://twitter.com/AmsterdamNL/status/1350794129618464768] Amsterdam’s mayor, the police force and the Netherlands Public Prosecution Service[https://www.prosecutionservice.nl/] to send in riot police officers.
There have been several protests in the Netherlands pver lockdowns and coronavirus measures, as well as protests in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.
“We want to party and go to clubs, we are so tired of all these measures,” a younger woman could be heard saying on the livestream[https://www.ongehoordnederland.nl/arnold-karskens-live-vanaf-het-museumplein/] of a new Dutch broadcaster called Ongehoord Nederland.
“Traditional media is saying these people are silly and mad, but a demonstration such as this one is a sign of broader dissatisfaction,” said Arnold Karskens, the managing director of the channel. (Mr. Karskens has also opposed the abolishment of Black Pete[https://www.npr.org/2020/06/24/882816031/so-long-black-pete?t=1610902481222], a controversial Dutch traditional figure in blackface, who Mr. Karskens says is mythological.)
“The truth is people are tired of all these measures,” he added. “They feel there is no end in sight.”
