New York is the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak
Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York has issued a sweeping executive order[https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-shelter-in-place-coronavirus.html] that will essentially put the state on lockdown, after its caseload soared to nearly 8,000[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html#link-36e2b5a5], from fewer than 700 at the beginning of the week.
New York is now the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, with nearly half of the country’s confirmed infections — and only six percent of its population.
The startling uptick is partly the result of ramped-up testing efforts. New York performed some 10,000 tests Thursday night alone, bringing its total to more than 32,000 and, Mr. Cuomo said, putting its per capita rate ahead of those of China and South Korea.
Beginning Sunday night, Mr. Cuomo said, people should leave home only for food, medicine and outdoor exercise. Businesses deemed essential[https://esd.ny.gov/guidance-executive-order-2026] will remain open, including grocers, restaurants with takeout or delivery, pharmacies, laundromats and, yes, liquor stores[https://www.nyslsa.com/news/494970/LIQUOR-STORES-DEEMED-ESSENTIAL-BUSINESS-CAN-REMAIN-OPEN.htm].
An economy in lockdown: Many stores and restaurants have had to close or scale back significantly because of the virus, today’s episode of “The Daily”[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/podcasts/the-daily/jobs-economy-coronavirus.html] reports.
On the front lines: The city’s delivery workers, mostly immigrants who earn low wages, are risking their health[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-delivery-workers.html] to meet the soaring demand from holed-up residents.

Hospitals prepare to ration care
Medical leaders in Washington State are quietly preparing for what only recently might have looked like a doomsday scenario: rationing medical care.
As the state’s hospitals fill up and supplies become scare[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/health/coronavirus-masks-shortage.html], officials have begun drafting plans for determining which patients would get full care, and which patients would get less — potentially resulting in their deaths.
This grim triage strategy, which would factor in a patient’s age, health and likelihood of survival, is an effort to standardize the state’s approach and take some heart-rending decisions out of the hands of individual doctors.
Medical rationing is already happening around the world. In Italy, guidelines reserve resources[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/europe/12italy-coronavirus-health-care.html] for those who have a “greater likelihood of survival” and “more potential years of life.”
In Spain, doctors are already choosing whom they can save[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/world/coronavirus-news.html]. Recommendations there include prioritizing patients with more than two years of life expectancy, and taking into account a patient’s value to society — a term that was not defined, and which could become bitterly controversial.
“We have to choose whom we intubate,” said one doctor working in an emergency room in Madrid. “We can’t use it on everyone anymore.”
Researchers at Columbia University created a model of how the outbreak could evolve in the U.S., and the results are sobering.
Even if the country cuts its rate of transmission in half — a tall order — some 650,000 people might become infected in the next two months, the researchers say. Without widespread intervention, things could get much worse.

In their words
Like readers around the world, New York Times journalists are confronting the virus — through their reporting, their aging relatives and even their own health.
Jason Horowitz, our Rome bureau chief, has been covering the unfolding catastrophe in Northern Italy. When the virus first started to spread there, he was on a family ski vacation[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/world/europe/italy-coronavirus-frontlines-quarantine.html].
As I drove the few remaining miles to drop my family off at the lodge, I alternated between apologizing to my wife, Claudia, and asking her to read out loud Italian news reports.
Outside the lodge it was incredibly quiet and white. As Claudia checked in, and the photographer waited anxiously in the car, I dug through the luggage, and grabbed some essentials. I kissed my family goodbye and left them under the Matterhorn. It was the last time I’d touch them for a month.
Dan Barry, a longtime reporter and columnist, documented a family’s wrenching decision: whether to remove their patriarch, Joseph Trinity, from a nursing home[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/nyregion/coronavirus-nursing-home.html].
Mr. Trinity had found himself in a New Jersey rehabilitation facility that, like most health care institutions across the country, had declared a no-visitor policy to stem contagion. But he is 92, and in fragile health; family sustains him.
Several times a day, he would call his daughter, Mary Trinity, to ask in a faint, slightly garbled voice where everyone was — and to beg her to please, please, get him out of there.
And Tim Herrera, our Smarter Living editor, wrote about the chaotic process of getting tested for the virus in New York City[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/nyregion/coronavirus-testing-positive.html].
Almost a dozen calls with five health care providers over five hours. Two hours of hold music. Two hours in a hospital. Four days of anxiously checking an online portal for results. And lots of confusion.
That’s the winding path through bureaucracy that took me from placing my first phone call last Wednesday to getting my positive coronavirus test results on Monday night.
Hot spots
* Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, bowing to intense pressure, told restaurants, bars, cafes and health clubs to close.
* Hong Kong saw its biggest daily jump in confirmed coronavirus infections on Friday; most new patients had recently traveled to Europe, North America or Southeast Asia, an official said.
* Australian officials are trying to track down thousands of passengers who left a Princess Cruise ship in Sydney on Thursday, after four people who were on board tested positive.

What you’re doing
My husband and I adopted a puppy. We have wanted a dog for awhile but timing was never right. Then all of a sudden, we are working from home till May. We had a puppy within 36 hours of getting word from our companies. And what a delightful, bright distraction he has turned out to be. It’s bliss to just turn off the news and play ball.
