At Berkeley, a virus surge forces a stringent lockdown.
At the Berkeley campus of the University of California, this was to be the month that academic life began inching back toward normal. Some students who had been sent home last year returned to their dorms in January. The first handful of in-person classes since the pandemic began had been set to resume[https://www.dailycal.org/2021/01/19/uc-berkeley-to-pilot-small-number-of-in-person-classes-for-spring-semester/] on Feb. 1.
Instead, a wave of coronavirus infections has sent the campus into an unprecedented lockdown.
Since the beginning of the month, some 2,000 students have been confined to their rooms around the clock, unable even to visit floor-mates. The students are allowed out to go to the bathroom, get food and take twice-weekly coronavirus tests. (There are also exceptions for rare medical needs or emergencies.)
Classes are being held remotely for the foreseeable future.
Confined students are barred even from going outside to sunbathe or exercise, although the university is talking with city health officials about relaxing that prohibition.
“It’s been a little bit of a struggle,” Veronica Roseborough, a freshman quarantined in one eight-story residence hall, said on Wednesday, “but the university is doing what it can to keep cases low.”
The lockdown was ordered after the university reported 44 new infections among its staff and 43,000-plus students on Jan. 30. Since then, 183 more cases have been found, bringing the total since Sept. 9[https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/dashboard/] to 724.
The number of new infections has declined since the quarantine began, officials said, but the lockdown will not end until Feb. 15.
The quarantine is not the only one on a college campus. (Last year, the University of Wisconsin-Madison shuttered 2,000 students in two dorms, and schools nationwide are struggling[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/us/colleges-covid.html] to control outbreaks.) But it might be the most rigid[https://mailchi.mp/1d6dac712b07/urgent-sequestering-extended-until-monday-feb-15-for-all-residential-hall-residents].
Security has been increased in residence halls to spot rule breakers and unwanted visitors. A cellphone-based “badge”[https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu] (green for already tested, yellow for a missed test, orange and red for quarantined and Covid-19-positive) is subject to checking by so-called health ambassadors.
Flouting the rules can be costly. Violators can be suspended from classes, and student organizations can be deregistered.
But some students remain undeterred by the penalties.
“Some may disagree with me,” said one student who claimed to slip out regularly to socialize with friends (“I make sure they have a test”).
“My mental health is very important,” the student said.
