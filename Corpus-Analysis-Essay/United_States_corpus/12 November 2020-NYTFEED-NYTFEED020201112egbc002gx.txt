Fauci urges Americans to ‘double down’ on the basics as virus cases spike.
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States, urged Americans on Thursday to “double down” on basic precautions as coronavirus cases soared across the country and more Covid-19 patients were hospitalized than ever before.
Appearing on “Good Morning America,”[https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/news/video/dr-fauci-explains-steps-slow-cases-shutdown-74166068] Dr. Fauci reiterated that a nationwide lockdown was unlikely, saying there was “no appetite for locking down in the American public.” But he expressed confidence that virus cases could be reduced without such drastic measures — if Americans “double down” on basic preventive steps, like social distancing and masks.
“I believe that we can do it without a lockdown, I really do,” he said.
Here are three key takeaways about the virus in the U.S. today.
The numbers are grim, and likely to worsen.
Dr. Fauci’s remarks were made just hours before California reported its millionth case on Thursday, the second state to do so (Texas was first). More cases are being recorded than ever before: The 142,000 reported on Wednesday set yet another record as much of the country enters a period of cold weather, indoor life, colds and flus that are expected to add fuel to the contagion.
Even more troubling than the infections are the hospitalization figures, as several parts of the nation report that their hospital facilities and personnel are being stretched beyond capacity. On Wednesday, 65,368 people were hospitalized with Covid-19, a figure that has doubled in little over a month, breaking the record set a day earlier by more than 3,400.
All told, the United States has reported more than 10.5 million cases so far, and more than 241,000 virus-related deaths, the most in the world: The pandemic is killing Americans at a pace of about 1,000 a day.
States and cities are taking more aggressive measures.
Since Election Day, more than a third of the governors across the United States, Republicans and Democrats, have issued public appeals for people to take coronavirus prevention measures seriously, as the latest surge — the biggest so far — washes across the nation. Many also imposed new limits on public and private gatherings.
In many places, the changes are affecting schools and youth activities, even as research is increasingly indicating that children younger than 10 are at less risk of contracting and transmitting the virus.
Detroit’s public school system announced on Thursday[https://www.detroitk12.org/site/default.aspx?PageType=3&DomainID=4&ModuleInstanceID=4585&ViewID=6446EE88-D30C-497E-9316-3F8874B3E108&RenderLoc=0&FlexDataID=41744&PageID=1] that it would shift to online, remote learning until January. New York City is weighing[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/12/nyregion/nyc-schools-coronavirus.html] closing its system, the nation’s largest. The governors of seven Northeastern states agreed on Thursday to suspend interstate youth hockey competition for the rest of the year after outbreaks were linked to games.
“Help is on the way,” Fauci says about vaccines in general. “But it isn’t here yet.”
There are signs of hope in scientific developments[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html]. The drug maker Pfizer announced[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/health/covid-vaccine-pfizer.html?searchResultPosition=1] this week that its experimental coronavirus vaccine was highly effective, according to an early analysis. Dr. Fauci said on “Good Morning America” that officials hope that “ordinary citizens should be able” to get a vaccine in the spring. Pfizer is expected to submit its data for review to the Food and Drug Administration once it has the necessary safety data next week. No coronavirus vaccine has yet been authorized by the U.S. government.[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html]
Moderna, Pfizer’s close competitor, announced on Wednesday that it had also reached a point in its late-stage trial that would allow it to begin analyzing data on its vaccine’s effectiveness. Both companies’ vaccines use the same technology, involving genetic material called mRNA, and both went into large trials on the same date in late July. Pfizer’s study has 44,000 participants, and Moderna’s 30,000.
The accelerating pace of the pandemic has helped to speed up testing for both companies, because researchers have to wait less time to see how many volunteers become infected. While the two companies are the frontrunners at the moment, nine others are pushing ahead with vaccine candidates[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html], including efforts in Britain, China, Russia and Australia, among others.
While companies and government health officials have offered hopeful projections, there is no guarantee that there will not be major delays or failures in the coming months. Pfizer’s vaccine results and other companies’ must still be evaluated for safety over a longer time period, data which aren’t expected to be available until next week. The F.D.A. could take longer than expected to evaluate Pfizer’s results. Complications could arise in what is a complex manufacturing and distribution effort[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/12/business/pfizer-covid-vaccine-coronavirus.html]. And supply could be further constrained if other experimental vaccines don’t work as hoped.
In another public appearance on Thursday, at an online forum hosted by the London think tank Chatham House[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1r4zc1fEI0&feature=emb_logo], Dr. Fauci said that he believed that vaccines would soon end the pandemic — although that might not mean the end of the virus, which health experts say could continue to circulate at lower levels.
“Certainly, it is not going to be a pandemic for a lot longer because I believe the vaccines are going to turn that around,” Dr. Fauci said.
But he repeated that basic protective practices remain the most crucial weapon against the virus.
“Help is on the way,” he said, speaking about vaccines in general. “But it isn’t here yet.”
