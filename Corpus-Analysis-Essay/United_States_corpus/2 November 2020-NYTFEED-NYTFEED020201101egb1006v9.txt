Dr. Scott Atlas, Trump’s Covid adviser, apologizes for appearing on a Russian news show.
Dr. Scott W. Atlas, the White House coronavirus adviser, apologized on Sunday for appearing on a Russian state-sponsored news show that has been instrumental in an effort by the Russian government to spread false health information during the pandemic[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/science/putin-russia-disinformation-health-coronavirus.html].
Dr. Atlas did not, however, apologize for the content of the interview, where he continued a pattern as Mr. Trump’s adviser of downplaying the severity of the coronavirus pandemic[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/us/politics/trump-scott-atlas-coronavirus.html], as well as asserting without evidence that lockdown measures used to contain the virus are “killing people.”
“The lockdowns will go down as an epic failure of public policy by people who refuse to accept they were wrong,” Dr. Atlas said in a nearly half-hour long interview on RT on Saturday. “The argument is undeniable, the lockdowns are killing people.”
In his apology, Dr. Atlas said that he had been unaware that the media outlet RT, formerly known as “Russia Today,[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/world/europe/russias-rt-network-is-it-more-bbc-or-kgb.html]” was a registered foreign agent. Many U.S. news organizations, including The New York Times, have reported that U.S. intelligence agencies consider RT to be a propaganda arm for Russia.
“I regret doing the interview and apologize for allowing myself to be taken advantage of,” Dr. Atlas said in a tweet[https://twitter.com/SWAtlasHoover/status/1322962638012358657]. “I especially apologize to the national security community who is working hard to defend us.”
An administration official who was not authorized to speak publicly said the interview was not approved by the White House press office.
Dr. Atlas, a neuroradiologist with no experience in infectious disease or epidemiology, has emerged as the president’s adviser in the White House to the exclusion of others on the formal coronavirus task force, and has embraced a national health response that would allow the coronavirus to spread naturally[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/health/coronavirus-great-barrington.html] in order to achieve “herd immunity.”
Such ideas have led to internal clashes on health policy — and sometimes turf wars within the White House — pitting Dr. Atlas against Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, and Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator.
Dr. Fauci criticized Dr. Atlas in an interview with The Washington Post on Friday, saying, “I have real problems with that guy.”“He’s a smart guy who’s talking about things that I believe he doesn’t have any real insight or knowledge or experience in,” Dr. Fauci said. “He keeps talking about things that when you dissect it out and parse it out, it doesn’t make any sense.”
Russian intelligence services have been spreading disinformation and propaganda[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/politics/russia-disinformation-coronavirus.html] about the coronavirus pandemic for months, using both Russian government outlets and other websites.
