Puerto Rico Orders Coronavirus Lockdown. Violators Could Be Fined.
In one of the most serious U.S. crackdowns yet over Covid-19, the governor ordered most businesses on the island to shut down. Other U.S. cities were imposing control measures of their own.
SAN JUAN, P.R. — Puerto Rico[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/us/puerto-rico-earthquake.html] imposed a curfew on Sunday and ordered most businesses shut down, imposing some of the most widespread restrictions yet seen in the United States as a growing number of jurisdictions moved to slow the spread of the coronavirus[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/us/puerto-rico-coronavirus.html].
Chiding Puerto Ricans for failing to heed warnings to stay home and observe social distancing, Gov. Wanda Vázquez signed an executive order instituting a two-week closure for the majority of businesses on the island, and a 9 p.m. overnight curfew through March 30.
The only exceptions to the closure orders are supermarkets; restaurants offering carryout or delivery; pharmacies; medical equipment stores; gas stations and banks, along with suppliers to those businesses. Violators of the lockdown order could face a fine of up to $5,000 or six months in jail.
“Given that the response from some citizens has not been adequate under the emergency situation, our priority is health and to protect the life of all of us who live on this island,” Ms. Vázquez said in a special televised address. “All citizens will have to stay home to stop the spread of this virus.”
The strict limits on movement are among the first of what is likely to be a cascading number across the country, amid growing alarm among officials that many Americans have ignored dire alerts that Covid-19 cases could overwhelm hospitals[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/us/hospitals-coronavirus.html]. Young people have continued to amass on beaches for Spring Break[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/virus-spring-break-florida.html], passengers have been forced into crowds at airports[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/airports-coronavirus.html] and people have continued to gather at bars and restaurants.
New closures and curfews were ordered one after another on Sunday. Miami and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., both popular among Spring Breakers, shut down much of their public beaches and imposed business closures. Washington, D.C., closed bars and restaurants. On Saturday, the mayor of Hoboken, N.J., imposed a nightly curfew that takes effect on Monday.
The New Orleans police cleared out Bourbon Street after the city banned mass gatherings. Boston ordered some bars shut to avoid the conglomeration of St. Patrick’s Day revelers, and the Illinois and Ohio governors ordered bars and restaurants in those states to shut down.
In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom called for the closure of bars, nightclubs, brew pubs and wineries, and for restaurants to reduce the number of patrons by half in order to provide more “social distancing.” He also called for all those aged 65 and older, who are especially vulnerable to the coronavirus, to remain at home.
In Puerto Rico, the governor’s orders specifically mentioned the shuttering of bars, shopping malls and movie theaters, all gathering places that had appeared packed on Saturday. The Latin trap artist Bad Bunny disappointed some fans on social media after he posted a selfie[https://twitter.com/sanbenito/status/1238931903157358599?s=20] of himself tightly hugging friends.
On Sunday, hours before the shutdown order was to take effect at 6 p.m., San Juan, the capital, bustled as usual. The crowds at Plaza Las Américas, the biggest shopping mall, seemed perhaps a bit thinner. The island’s schools had already been ordered closed for the next two weeks.
Cellphones buzzed in unison on Sunday afternoon with the sound of an emergency alert about the curfew.
“It seems like a pretty logical and fair measure to take at night,” one resident, Alexander Caraballo, said of the curfew after standing in a short line on Sunday at a homeopathic pharmacy in the town of Manatí to stock up on vitamin C and echinacea. The shop was letting customers in one at a time to avoid needless contact.
“I’ve personally been isolating myself, and taking preventive measures, and being disciplined to avoid contagion,” said Mr. Caraballo, 25, a freelance fashion and portrait photographer. At the supermarket, cashiers wore gloves, he said. “I’ve run into several acquaintances, worried but getting ready.”
Five coronavirus cases have been confirmed in Puerto Rico so far, though more are suspected. Ms. Vázquez, who assumed the governorship in August[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/07/us/puerto-rico-governor-wanda-vazquez.html] and is now running for the seat, appeared determined to avoid a deadly disaster similar to Hurricane Maria in 2017, which killed an estimated 2,975 Puerto Ricans. Her administration has already been criticized for getting slow Covid-19 test results from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Rafael Rodríguez Mercado, the health secretary, resigned on Friday.
One-fifth of Puerto Rico’s population of nearly 3.2 million is 65 or older, and the island’s health system struggled[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/us/puerto-rico-hurricane-healthcare-hospitals.html] after Hurricane Maria. Puerto Rico has also been dealing with the aftermath of earthquakes that sent thousands of fearful people to sleep outdoors[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/us/puerto-rico-earthquakes-fema.html].
“They’ve been really disorganized,” said Xiomara Liz Cortés Fuentes, 27, a teacher in Guaynabo who could not find hand sanitizer, rubbing alcohol or a thermometer at a Walgreens store for her husband, who has a stomach flu. “What most worries me, what I always think about, are older people. Puerto Rico’s health system is already collapsed, so it will only collapse faster with the number of people who will need care because the government measures have come too late.”
She added: “I think of my grandparents, my older uncles, my uncles with underlying conditions. And it’s terrifying.”
