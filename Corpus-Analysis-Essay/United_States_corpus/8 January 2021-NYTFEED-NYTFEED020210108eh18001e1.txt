Lawmakers fear a coronavirus outbreak after sharing close quarters in lockdown.
A day after members of Congress were relocated to secure locations as a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, raising fears about widespread transmission of the coronavirus, a House member revealed on Thursday that he had tested positive for the virus.
Representative Jake LaTurner, Republican of Kansas, announced on Twitter — hours after sharing space with colleagues on the House floor throughout a late-night session to confirm President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s Electoral College victory — that he had received a positive test[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/us/politics/a-congressman-who-voted-against-certification-tests-positive-for-covid-19.html], prompting further concern that the virus might have spread more widely.
While in lockdown on Wednesday, Representative Susan Wild, Democrat of Pennsylvania, told CBS News by phone[https://www.cbsnews.com/video/congresswoman-susan-wild-describes-holding-location-as-super-spreader-event-capitol-riot-2021-01-06/#x] that “about half” of the people sheltering in the secure location in the Capitol complex had refused to wear masks, even though masks were made available. When asked which lawmakers had declined to cover their faces, Ms. Wild said they had been “people from the Republican delegation.”
“It’s what I would call a Covid superspreader event,” she said. “It’s exactly the kind of situation that we’ve been told by the medical doctors not to be in, you know — close proximity — especially with people who aren’t wearing masks.”
It was not immediately clear whether Mr. LaTurner had been in the same location as Ms. Wild, though Ms. Wild said roughly 300 to 400 people were being held in the room with her.
As the violent mob stormed the Capitol, groups of lawmakers were kept together at secure locations, while others reported being stranded for a time[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/us/politics/congress-gop-subvert-election.html] in offices and hideaways throughout the building. Videos of the siege showed hundreds of members of the mob, most of them unmasked, clashing with Capitol Police officers and journalists inside the Capitol and on the surrounding grounds.
Mr. LaTurner’s announcement came after two other Republicans, Representatives Kevin Brady and Kay Granger, both from Texas, had tested positive for the virus earlier in the week. Both Mr. Brady and Ms. Granger were not in the Capitol on Wednesday because they were in quarantine.
