New claims for state unemployment benefits remained high last week.
More than four months after Americans began emerging from the coronavirus-caused lockdown across most states, the job market remains treacherous, according to new data from the Labor Department[https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf].
More than 857,000 workers filed new claims for state unemployment insurance last week, before seasonal adjustments, a slight increase from the previous week. Although the unemployment rate has fallen[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/business/economy/jobs-report.html] to 8.4 percent, the level of layoffs reflects the challenges for many workers in the fitful recovery.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, the total was 884,000, unchanged from the revised figure for the previous week.
In addition, about 839,000 new claims were filed under a federal program called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, which provides assistance to freelancers, part-time workers and others who do not ordinarily qualify for state benefits. That figure, which is not seasonally adjusted, represented a rise from 748,000 the previous week.
“It’s a gut punch to see these numbers every Thursday with no improvement,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm Grant Thornton in Chicago. “The numbers are going in the wrong direction.”
Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, said the latest numbers “are part of a transition to a slower pace of recovery, and one that will be more uneven.”
All told, nearly 30 million people were receiving unemployment benefits in some form in the week that ended Aug. 22.
A wild card in the outlook is congressional standoff over another coronavirus relief package. House Democrats have passed a $3 trillion bill that would restore a $600 weekly unemployment benefit supplement that expired in July. A much smaller Republican package reviving the supplement at $300 a week failed to advance[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/10/world/covid-19-coronavirus.html#link-3c53e6c9] in a Senate vote on Thursday.
President Trump ordered a stopgap $300-a-week replacement[https://www.nytimes.com/article/stimulus-unemployment-payment-benefit.html] last month through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but it has been slow to get off the ground and has funds for only a few weeks.
Eighteen states have begun making the payments, said Michele Evermore, senior researcher and policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project. “It would have been so much easier and faster if Congress would have passed an extension,” she said.
