Puerto Rico, recovering from a spring surge, lifted a curfew that was in effect throughout the pandemic.
As Puerto Rico recovers from a spring coronavirus surge and cases decline, the U.S. territory is steadily relaxing pandemic restrictions, including lifting a nightly curfew that was in effect since March 2020.
The island is taking a big step toward returning to normal not long after experiencing its worst outbreak. Toward the end of April, Puerto Rico was reporting over 1,000 cases a day, up from about 200 new daily cases in mid-March.
Since then, its case numbers have drastically decreased, as they have around the United States with the steady advance of vaccinations, which Dr. Carlos Mellado López[https://www.fortaleza.pr.gov/content/tarjeta-de-vacunaci-n-con-serie-completada-ser-el-pase-para-entrar-la-isla-sin-prueba], the head of Puerto Rico’s Department of Health, credited for the turnaround. Puerto Rico is averaging 146 new coronavirus cases daily over the past seven days, an almost 60 percent decrease over the past two weeks, according to a New York Times database[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/puerto-rico-covid-cases.html]. Just over 30 percent of the island’s population has been fully vaccinated and 45 percent has been given at least one vaccination, numbers that lag behind the U.S. averages of 39 and 49 percent, respectively.
The easing of restrictions took effect[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/puerto-rico-adjusts-travel-measures-removing-negative-covid-19-test-requirement-for-vaccinated-travelers-and-lifting-curfew-301297078.html] over the past two days, starting with the end of the 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew on Monday. Another change affects fully vaccinated travelers on domestic flights, who no longer need to present a negative coronavirus test before entry and instead must present proof of vaccination, such as a vaccine card.
Puerto Rico will offer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to any visitors who arrive at the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan, starting Friday, according to The Associated Press[https://apnews.com/article/puerto-rico-pandemics-health-coronavirus-pandemic-e08fe65a8b1a585ede833d615cf8b175]. Other changes include increased capacities for businesses from 30 percent to 50 percent, a reopening of the island’s stadiums at 30 percent capacity and a lifting of mask requirements for fully vaccinated people at parks and beaches.
On the mainland, state governments have been rapidly loosening restrictions. Louisiana’s governor said on Tuesday that the state would remove capacity restrictions for businesses and a mandate requiring students to wear masks at schools, starting next school year. New Jersey’s governor[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/24/nyregion/new-jersey-masks-indoors-vaccinated.html] said on Monday that fully vaccinated people would no longer have to wear masks indoors. In Hawaii, Gov. David Ige 
                     said on Tuesday[https://governor.hawaii.gov/newsroom/office-of-the-governor-news-release-governor-ige-lifts-mask-requirement-for-outdoor-activities-gives-green-light-to-ocean-sports-competitions-honolulu-and-kauai-county-orders-also-approved/] that all people, vaccinated and unvaccinated, would no longer have to wear masks outdoors.
In Puerto Rico, experts say many factors led to the island’s spring surge, including the arrival of coronavirus variants, a return to in-person work and dining, tourists flocking to the island for spring break season and gatherings to celebrate Holy Week. As cases soared, worries simmered over hospital bed capacity and the dearth of medical professionals needed to address a swell in sickness.
