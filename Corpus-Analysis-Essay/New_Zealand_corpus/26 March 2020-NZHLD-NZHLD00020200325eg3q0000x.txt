Rents are frozen and evictions banned
Landlords will not be allowed to increase rents or kick out their tenants except for in very specific situations during the four-week Covid-19 lockdown
The Government was to pass an urgent piece of legislation yesterday to ensure renters wouldn’t suddenly be homeless.
Housing Minister Megan Woods said there was also an obligation on tenants not to abuse the situation.
One of the situations where a renter could be evicted is if they don’t pay rent for 60 days without making a reasonable effort to do so.
The rent freeze is set to last for six months and the protections against evictions will last for three months, but both could be extended.
But rent increases that were notified before the three-month period began but had not yet come into effect will still be allowed.
Any landlord who breaks the new rules could be fined up to $6500 in each case by the Tenancy Tribunal.
The new rules were set out in an urgent bill that was to be passed in Parliament.
The key points are:
●An immediate freeze on rent increases
●Tenancies will not be terminated during the lockdown period, unless the parties agree, or in limited circumstances
●Tenants who had previously given notice can stay on if they need to stay during the lockdown period
●Tenants will still be able to terminate their tenancy as normal, if they wish
Housing Minister Megan Woods said the changes allowed New Zealanders to stay in their homes during “this challenging time” and ensured people could self-isolate.
“It also means that in the short-term, families and individuals who are tenants do not lose their home due to a drop in income related to job losses through Covid-19.”
Under the new rules, tenants can still be evicted if they:
●Substantially damage the property
●Assault or threaten their landlord, their family or their neighbours
●Abandon the property
●Engage in “significant” anti-social behaviour, generally illegal activity
●Are 60 days behind in rent, but the Tenancy Tribunal will need to take into account whether the tenant has made a reasonable effort to make the payment
